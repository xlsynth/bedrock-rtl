| push_valid        | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `push_valid` indicates when valid data is available to be written into the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules set `push_valid` to high (1) when they have data ready on `push_data` that they wish to push into the FIFO. It works in conjunction with `push_ready` to manage data flow into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is high and `push_ready` is also high, the data on `push_data` is successfully written into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_valid` is high but `push_ready` is low, it indicates that the FIFO cannot accept new data, possibly due to being full or experiencing backpressure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is low, it means there is no new data to be pushed into the FIFO, regardless of the state of `push_ready`.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableBypass` is set to 1 and the FIFO is empty, `push_valid` can lead to immediate data availability at the pop interface, minimizing latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The stability of `push_valid` during backpressure conditions can be asserted or covered based on the `EnableAssertPushValidStability` parameter, ensuring that `push_valid` remains stable when the FIFO is full and cannot accept new data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| push_data         | **Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_data` port is used to input data into the FIFO for storage and eventual retrieval.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_data` port by driving it with data they wish to store in the FIFO. This data is presented alongside a valid signal (`push_valid`) to indicate that the data is ready to be pushed into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, the data on `push_data` is captured and stored in the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The width of `push_data` is determined by the `Width` parameter, allowing for flexibility in the size of data entries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `Width` is set to 8, `push_data` can hold an 8-bit value, such as `8'b10101010`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_valid` is not asserted, the data on `push_data` is ignored, and no operation occurs.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `EnableBypass` is set to 1 and the FIFO is empty, data on `push_data` can be immediately available at the `pop_data` output, minimizing latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The stability of `push_data` is crucial when backpressure is applied (`push_ready` is low), especially if `EnableAssertPushDataStability` is enabled, ensuring data integrity during these conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| pop_ready         | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_ready` port indicates the readiness of the downstream logic to accept data from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules assert `pop_ready` to signal that they are ready to receive data from the FIFO. This interaction is crucial for the flow of data from the FIFO to the consumer.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted (logic high), it indicates that the downstream logic is ready to accept data. If `pop_valid` is also asserted, data transfer occurs from the FIFO to the consumer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is deasserted (logic low), it indicates that the downstream logic cannot accept data, and the FIFO will not present new data on `pop_data`, even if `pop_valid` is asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `pop_ready` is high and `pop_valid` is high, the data on `pop_data` is considered valid and is consumed by the downstream logic.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `pop_ready` and `pop_valid` is part of a handshake mechanism that ensures data is only transferred when both the producer (FIFO) and consumer (downstream logic) are ready, preventing data loss or corruption.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_ready` directly affects the `empty` and `empty_next` signals, as asserting `pop_ready` when `pop_valid` is high will decrease the number of items in the FIFO, potentially changing these status flags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ram_rd_data_valid | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `ram_rd_data_valid` port indicates the validity of the data being read from the RAM. It signals when the data on the `ram_rd_data` port is ready to be used.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `ram_rd_data_valid` port by monitoring its state to determine when the data read from the RAM is valid and can be processed. This port is typically used in conjunction with the `ram_rd_data` port to ensure that the data being read is correctly synchronized with the rest of the system.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `ram_rd_data_valid` is asserted (logic high), it indicates that the data on the `ram_rd_data` port is valid and can be used by the receiving logic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `ram_rd_data_valid` is not asserted (logic low), the data on the `ram_rd_data` port should not be considered valid, and any logic dependent on this data should wait until `ram_rd_data_valid` is asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `RamReadLatency` is set to 2, `ram_rd_data_valid` will be asserted two cycles after `ram_rd_addr_valid` is asserted, indicating that the data is ready to be read.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The timing of `ram_rd_data_valid` is crucial for maintaining data integrity and synchronization within the FIFO controller. It ensures that data is only processed when it is fully available, preventing potential data hazards.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `ram_rd_data_valid` is influenced by the `RamReadLatency` parameter, which determines the number of cycles between asserting `ram_rd_addr_valid` and `ram_rd_data_valid`. This allows the FIFO controller to accommodate RAMs with different read latencies. |

| push_ready        | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_ready` port indicates whether the FIFO is ready to accept new data on the push interface.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_ready` port by checking its value before attempting to send data to the FIFO. If `push_ready` is high, the module can assert `push_valid` and provide data on `push_data`.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `push_ready` = 0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_ready` is high (1), the FIFO can accept new data, and the user can assert `push_valid` with valid data on `push_data`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_ready` is low (0), the FIFO is not ready to accept new data, typically because it is full or experiencing backpressure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `full` is asserted, `push_ready` will be low, indicating that no more data can be pushed until space is available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and the FIFO is not empty, `push_ready` may transition to high if space becomes available due to data being popped.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `push_ready` is directly influenced by the `full` status of the FIFO. When `full` is high, `push_ready` will be low, preventing further data from being pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `EnableBypass` parameter can affect the timing of `push_ready`. If bypass is enabled, `push_ready` may become high more quickly after a pop operation, as data can be pushed directly to the pop interface or staging buffer when the FIFO is nearly empty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_ready` signal is crucial for managing flow control and preventing data loss due to overfilling the FIFO. |
| pop_valid         | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_valid` indicates when valid data is available at the `pop_data` output for consumption by downstream logic.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor `pop_valid` to determine when they can safely read data from `pop_data`. When `pop_valid` is asserted, it signifies that the data on `pop_data` is valid and ready to be used.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_valid` = 0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and the FIFO is not empty (`empty` = 0), `pop_valid` is asserted, indicating that valid data is available at `pop_data`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableBypass` is set to 1 and the FIFO is empty, `pop_valid` can be asserted immediately when `push_valid` is asserted, allowing for zero-cycle cut-through latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableBypass` is 0, `pop_valid` will only be asserted after data has been written to and read from the RAM, introducing a latency of at least 1 cycle plus `RamReadLatency`.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `EnableBypass` is enabled, `pop_valid` can be asserted in the same cycle as `push_valid` if the FIFO is empty, allowing immediate data availability.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The assertion of `pop_valid` is dependent on the FIFO's internal state, which is influenced by parameters like `Depth`, `RamReadLatency`, and `RegisterPopOutputs`, affecting the timing and latency of data availability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| pop_data          | **Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_data` is used to output the data from the FIFO when a pop operation is performed.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with `pop_data` by reading its value when `pop_valid` is asserted, indicating that valid data is available to be read from the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_valid` is high and `pop_ready` is asserted, `pop_data` presents the data that is being read from the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data output on `pop_data` corresponds to the data that was first pushed into the FIFO, following the FIFO's first-in, first-out order.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_data` is typically set to 0, as it is not assigned a specific value during reset.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableBypass` is set to 1 and the FIFO is empty, `pop_data` can directly reflect `push_data` when `push_valid` is asserted, allowing for zero-cycle latency in data transfer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `RegisterPopOutputs` is enabled, `pop_data` may have an additional cycle of latency, as the data is registered before being output.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `pop_data` is stable and valid only when `pop_valid` is high, ensuring that downstream logic only processes valid data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| full              | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `full` port indicates whether the FIFO is currently full, meaning it cannot accept any more data until space is freed by a pop operation.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `full` port by monitoring its status to determine if they can push new data into the FIFO. If `full` is asserted (i.e., logic high), the FIFO is full, and no new data should be pushed.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `full` is asserted, it indicates that the FIFO has reached its maximum capacity (`Depth` entries), and the `push_ready` signal will be deasserted, preventing new data from being pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `full` is deasserted, it indicates that there is at least one slot available in the FIFO for new data, and `push_ready` will be asserted, allowing data to be pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `full` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is empty and ready to accept new data.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `full` signal is directly influenced by the `Depth` parameter, which defines the maximum number of entries the FIFO can hold.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `full` can be affected by the `EnableBypass` parameter. If bypass is enabled, the FIFO may temporarily appear not full even when it is close to capacity, due to the cut-through path allowing data to move directly from push to pop.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `full` signal is also related to the `slots` and `items` signals, as `full` is asserted when `slots` equals zero, meaning no more space is available for new entries.                                                                                          |
| full_next         | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `full_next` port indicates whether the FIFO will be full in the next clock cycle.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `full_next` signal to anticipate when the FIFO will become full, allowing them to manage data flow and avoid overflows by controlling the `push_valid` signal accordingly.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `full_next` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is not expected to be full in the next cycle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and the FIFO is not currently full, `full_next` will be set to 1 if the FIFO will be full after the current push operation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the FIFO is already full, `full_next` remains 1 until a pop operation occurs, making space for new data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and a pop operation occurs, `full_next` will be set to 0 if the FIFO will not be full after the current pop operation.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `full_next` signal provides a predictive indication of the FIFO's status, allowing for proactive management of data flow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In scenarios where `EnableBypass` is set to 1, `full_next` may transition to 0 more quickly due to the bypass mechanism, which can reduce the effective depth of the FIFO temporarily.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| slots             | **Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `slots` port indicates the number of available slots in the FIFO for new data entries.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `slots` port to determine how many additional entries can be pushed into the FIFO without causing overflow. This information is crucial for managing data flow and preventing data loss due to overfilling the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `slots` = `Depth`, indicating that the FIFO is empty and all slots are available for new data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, a new data entry is pushed into the FIFO, and `slots` decreases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high, a data entry is removed from the FIFO, and `slots` increases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the FIFO is full (`full` is high), `slots` will be 0, indicating no available slots for new data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the FIFO is empty (`empty` is high), `slots` will equal `Depth`, indicating all slots are available.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `EnableBypass` is set to 1, the FIFO can achieve a cut-through latency of zero cycles, which may affect how quickly `slots` updates in response to `push_valid` and `pop_ready` signals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `slots` value dynamically adjusts based on the interaction between `push_valid`, `push_ready`, `pop_ready`, and `pop_valid`, reflecting the real-time availability of space in the FIFO.                                                                                                                                     |
| slots_next        | **Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `slots_next` indicates the number of available slots in the FIFO for new data entries in the next clock cycle.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor `slots_next` to determine how many new data entries can be pushed into the FIFO in the upcoming cycle. This information is crucial for managing data flow and avoiding overflow conditions.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `slots_next` = `Depth`, indicating that all slots are available for new entries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, a new data entry is pushed into the FIFO, reducing the available slots. Consequently, `slots_next` decreases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high, a data entry is removed from the FIFO, increasing the available slots. Thus, `slots_next` increases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If neither push nor pop operations occur, `slots_next` remains unchanged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The sum of `slots_next` and `items_next` should always equal `Depth`, maintaining the coherence of the FIFO's state.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When the FIFO is full (`full` is high), `slots_next` will be zero, indicating no available slots for new entries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, when the FIFO is empty (`empty` is high), `slots_next` will equal `Depth`, indicating all slots are available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `slots_next` is directly influenced by the parameters `Depth`, `EnableBypass`, and `RamReadLatency`, which can affect how quickly slots become available after a push or pop operation.             |
| empty             | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `empty` port indicates whether the FIFO is currently empty, meaning there are no items available for reading.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `empty` port to determine if there are any items available to be read from the FIFO. This signal can be used to control read operations or to trigger other processes when the FIFO becomes empty.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `empty` is high (1), it signifies that the FIFO contains no items, and thus, no data can be read.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `empty` is low (0), it indicates that there are items in the FIFO available for reading.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `empty` signal is updated based on the push and pop operations. For example, if an item is pushed into an empty FIFO, `empty` will transition from 1 to 0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `empty` = 1, indicating the FIFO starts in an empty state.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `empty` signal can change state based on the interaction between `push_valid` and `pop_ready`. For instance, if `push_valid` is asserted and a new item is pushed into the FIFO, `empty` will go low if it was previously high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `empty` signal is also influenced by the `EnableBypass` parameter. If bypass is enabled, the FIFO can appear non-empty even with minimal items due to direct forwarding, affecting the `empty` status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Depth                          | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `Depth` parameter defines the number of entries in the FIFO, determining its storage capacity. It influences how many data items can be stored in the FIFO at any given time. Users interact with the design by pushing data into the FIFO until it reaches its maximum capacity, as indicated by the `full` signal. When the FIFO is not full, `push_ready` is asserted, allowing new data to be pushed. Conversely, when the FIFO is empty, `pop_valid` is deasserted, indicating no data is available to pop. The `Depth` parameter must be set to at least 2 to ensure proper FIFO operation, allowing for both read and write operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Width                          | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `Width` parameter defines the bit-width of each data entry in the FIFO. It determines how many bits are used to represent each piece of data that is pushed into or popped from the FIFO. Users interact with the design by providing data of this specified width through the `push_data` signal when `push_valid` is asserted. The design ensures that the data width is consistent across the FIFO operations, affecting signals like `pop_data`, `ram_wr_data`, and `ram_rd_data`. This parameter allows users to configure the FIFO to handle data of varying sizes, accommodating different application requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| EnableBypass                   | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableBypass` parameter controls the data flow path within the FIFO controller. When enabled, it allows data to bypass the RAM and move directly from the push interface to the pop interface or staging buffer when the FIFO is nearly empty. This configuration minimizes latency, achieving a cut-through latency of zero cycles, which is beneficial for designs prioritizing speed. However, this comes at the cost of potentially worse timing due to the creation of a combinational path between the push and pop interfaces. Conversely, when `EnableBypass` is disabled, data must pass through the RAM before reaching the pop interface, resulting in a longer cut-through latency but improving static timing by eliminating direct combinational paths. This setting is useful for designs where timing closure is critical.                                                      |
| RegisterPopOutputs             | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter is used to control the timing characteristics of the FIFO's pop interface. When set, it ensures that the `pop_valid` and `pop_data` signals are always sourced from a register, which can improve timing paths that depend on these outputs. This comes at the cost of an additional cycle of latency for data to propagate from the push to the pop interface. Users can interact with this parameter to optimize the design for either lower latency or better timing closure, depending on their specific application needs. For example, enabling this parameter might be beneficial in scenarios where the design is struggling to meet timing requirements, while disabling it could be advantageous when minimizing latency is a priority.                                                                                                                 |
| RamReadLatency                 | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `RamReadLatency` parameter specifies the number of clock cycles between asserting `ram_rd_addr_valid` and receiving valid data on `ram_rd_data`. It allows users to configure the FIFO controller to accommodate RAMs with varying read latencies. For example, if a RAM takes two cycles to return data after a read request, setting `RamReadLatency` to 2 ensures that the FIFO controller correctly synchronizes the read operations. This parameter is crucial for maintaining a synchronous ready/valid interface at the pop interface, especially when the RAM read latency is greater than zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| RamDepth                       | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `RamDepth` parameter defines the actual storage capacity of the external RAM used by the FIFO controller. It determines how many entries the RAM can hold, which may differ from the FIFO's logical depth (`Depth`). This parameter allows flexibility in RAM sizing, accommodating scenarios where the RAM's physical depth might be larger or smaller than the FIFO's logical depth. Users can adjust `RamDepth` to optimize for hardware constraints or performance requirements, ensuring efficient memory utilization while maintaining the FIFO's operational integrity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| EnableCoverPushBackpressure    | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableCoverPushBackpressure` parameter is used to control the coverage of backpressure scenarios on the push side of the FIFO controller. When enabled, it ensures that the design accounts for situations where the push interface experiences backpressure, meaning that the FIFO cannot accept new data because it is full or nearly full. This parameter is crucial for verifying that the FIFO can handle such conditions correctly. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to ensure that the design is tested for robustness against backpressure, which can occur when the `full` signal is asserted, indicating that the FIFO cannot accept more data. This helps in validating that the FIFO's behavior is as expected under these conditions, ensuring reliable data handling and flow control.                                                                            |
| EnableAssertPushValidStability | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableAssertPushValidStability` parameter is used to control the assertion behavior related to the stability of the `push_valid` signal during backpressure conditions. When enabled, it ensures that the `push_valid` signal remains stable (i.e., does not change) when the FIFO is experiencing backpressure, meaning the FIFO cannot accept new data because it is full or nearly full. This parameter is particularly useful for verifying that the design maintains consistent behavior under backpressure, preventing potential data corruption or loss. Users can enable this parameter to assert that `push_valid` remains unchanged during these conditions, ensuring reliable data handling in scenarios where the FIFO is unable to immediately process incoming data.                                                                                                              |
| EnableAssertPushDataStability  | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableAssertPushDataStability` parameter is used to control the stability of the `push_data` signal when the FIFO experiences backpressure. When enabled, it ensures that `push_data` remains stable and does not change while the FIFO is full and unable to accept new data. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity during periods when `push_ready` is not asserted due to the FIFO being full. Users can rely on this parameter to assert that the data being pushed into the FIFO remains consistent until it is successfully written, preventing any unintended data corruption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| EnableAssertFinalNotValid      | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableAssertFinalNotValid` parameter is used to ensure that the FIFO is empty and no valid signals are asserted at the end of a test. When enabled, it asserts that the FIFO has been completely drained and all operations have concluded without leaving any residual data. This parameter is particularly useful for verification purposes, allowing users to confirm that the FIFO has been correctly emptied and reset to its initial state after all push and pop operations. It helps in identifying any issues related to data retention or incomplete operations within the FIFO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| AddrWidth                      | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>`AddrWidth` determines the bit-width of the address signals used for accessing the RAM in the FIFO controller. It is calculated based on the `RamDepth` parameter, ensuring that the address lines are wide enough to uniquely address each entry in the RAM. This parameter is crucial for defining the size of the address bus, which facilitates the correct reading and writing of data to and from the RAM. Users interact with this parameter indirectly by setting the `RamDepth`, which in turn influences the `AddrWidth`. The expected behavior is that the address width is sufficient to cover all possible addresses within the specified RAM depth, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval operations.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| CountWidth                     | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>`CountWidth` determines the bit-width required to represent the count of items or slots in the FIFO. It is calculated based on the `Depth` parameter, which defines the maximum number of entries the FIFO can hold. This parameter ensures that the design can accurately track the number of items currently stored in the FIFO, as well as the number of available slots for new entries. Users interact with this parameter indirectly by configuring the `Depth` of the FIFO, which in turn influences the `CountWidth`. For example, if the FIFO is configured to hold a larger number of entries, `CountWidth` will increase to accommodate the larger range of counts. This parameter is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the FIFO's status flags, such as `items`, `items_next`, `slots`, and `slots_next`, ensuring they can represent all possible states of the FIFO accurately. |

| Bypass Mode Cut-Through Latency Management | Description: This function manages the cut-through latency when the FIFO is in bypass mode. It ensures that data can be transferred with minimal latency when the FIFO is empty and bypass conditions are met, leveraging the EnableBypass and RegisterPopOutputs parameters.<br>Input Signals: push_valid, push_data, pop_ready<br>Output Signals: pop_valid, pop_data, bypass_ready<br><br>Transactions:<br><br>Transaction 1:<br>1. The testbench asserts `push_valid` to indicate valid data is available for pushing.<br>2. The testbench provides data on `push_data`.<br>3. The design checks if the FIFO is empty and if bypass conditions are met.<br>4. If conditions are met, the design asserts `bypass_ready` to indicate readiness to accept bypass data.<br>5. The design asserts `pop_valid` to indicate valid data is available for popping.<br>6. The design provides data on `pop_data` directly from `push_data`.<br><br><br><br>Transaction 2:<br>1. The testbench asserts `pop_ready` to indicate readiness to receive data.<br>2. The design checks if `bypass_ready` is asserted.<br>3. If `bypass_ready` is asserted, the design maintains `pop_valid` and continues providing data on `pop_data`.<br>4. The testbench reads `pop_data` when `pop_valid` is asserted.<br>  |
| FIFO Empty Status Update                   | Description: This function updates the empty status of the FIFO, indicating whether the FIFO is empty based on the current and next item counts.<br>Input Signals: pop_ready, ram_rd_data_valid<br>Output Signals: empty, empty_next, items, items_next<br><br>Transactions:<br><br>Transaction 1:<br>1. The design continuously monitors `pop_ready` and `ram_rd_data_valid` to determine the current operation state.<br>2. The design updates `items_next` based on whether a pop operation is successful.<br>3. The design updates `empty_next` to reflect whether the FIFO will be empty after the current operation.<br>4. The design updates `items` with the value of `items_next` in the next cycle.<br>5. The design updates `empty` with the value of `empty_next` in the next cycle.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Items Status Update                        | Description: This function updates the current and next item counts in the FIFO, reflecting the number of items stored. It ensures accurate tracking of FIFO content.<br>Input Signals: push_valid, pop_ready<br>Output Signals: items, items_next<br><br>Transactions:<br><br>Transaction 1:<br>1. The design continuously monitors `push_valid` and `pop_ready`.<br>2. If `push_valid` is asserted and `pop_ready` is deasserted, the design increments `items_next` by 1.<br>3. If `pop_ready` is asserted and `push_valid` is deasserted, the design decrements `items_next` by 1.<br>4. If both `push_valid` and `pop_ready` are asserted, `items_next` remains unchanged.<br>5. The design updates `items` with the value of `items_next` in the next cycle.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| FIFO Data Transfer with Bypass Enabled  | Operations: Push data into the FIFO and pop data out, utilizing the bypass feature to minimize latency. The design allows data to be pushed into the FIFO when `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, indicating space is available. When the FIFO is empty and bypass conditions are met (`EnableBypass` is set), data can be directly transferred from `push_data` to `pop_data` with zero cut-through latency. The design asserts `pop_valid` when `pop_ready` is high, and data is available for popping. The `pop_data` is provided directly from `push_data` when bypass is active, otherwise, it is retrieved from the RAM. The FIFO status flags `full`, `empty`, `items`, and `slots` are updated accordingly to reflect the current state of the FIFO. The design ensures that `ram_wr_valid` and `ram_rd_addr_valid` are asserted appropriately to manage RAM operations, with addresses provided on `ram_wr_addr` and `ram_rd_addr`. The design maintains coherence between `items` and `slots` to ensure accurate tracking of FIFO occupancy. |
| FIFO Data Transfer with Bypass Disabled | Operations: Push data into the FIFO and pop data out, with bypass disabled to improve timing. The design allows data to be pushed into the FIFO when `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, indicating space is available. With bypass disabled (`EnableBypass` is cleared), data must pass through the RAM before becoming available at the pop interface. The design asserts `pop_valid` when `pop_ready` is high, and data is available for popping after the RAM read latency. The `pop_data` is retrieved from the RAM, with `ram_rd_data_valid` indicating valid data is available. The FIFO status flags `full`, `empty`, `items`, and `slots` are updated accordingly to reflect the current state of the FIFO. The design ensures that `ram_wr_valid` and `ram_rd_addr_valid` are asserted appropriately to manage RAM operations, with addresses provided on `ram_wr_addr` and `ram_rd_addr`. The design maintains coherence between `items` and `slots` to ensure accurate tracking of FIFO occupancy.                                          |
| FIFO Status Monitoring and Management   | Operations: Monitor and manage the FIFO status flags to ensure accurate tracking of FIFO occupancy and readiness. The design continuously updates `full`, `full_next`, `empty`, `empty_next`, `items`, `items_next`, `slots`, and `slots_next` based on the current push and pop operations. The `full` flag is asserted when the FIFO is full, preventing further pushes until space is available. The `empty` flag is asserted when the FIFO is empty, preventing pops until data is available. The design calculates `slots_next` and `items_next` based on the current push and pop operations, ensuring accurate tracking of available slots and stored items. The design ensures that `ram_wr_valid` and `ram_rd_addr_valid` are asserted appropriately to manage RAM operations, with addresses provided on `ram_wr_addr` and `ram_rd_addr`. The design maintains coherence between `items` and `slots` to ensure accurate tracking of FIFO occupancy.                                                                                                          |
