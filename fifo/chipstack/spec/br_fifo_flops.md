| push_valid | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_valid` port indicates when valid data is available to be pushed into the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules set `push_valid` to high (1) when they have valid data on the `push_data` port that they wish to store in the FIFO. It works in conjunction with the `push_ready` signal to manage data flow into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is high and `push_ready` is also high, the data on `push_data` is successfully pushed into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_valid` is high but `push_ready` is low, it indicates that the FIFO cannot accept new data, and the user must hold the data until `push_ready` goes high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is low, it indicates that there is no valid data to push, and the FIFO will not attempt to read from `push_data`.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableBypass` is set to 1 and the FIFO is empty, data can be pushed directly to the pop interface with zero latency, provided `pop_ready` is also high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The stability of `push_valid` during backpressure conditions can be asserted or covered based on the `EnableAssertPushValidStability` parameter, which can affect how the system handles scenarios where the FIFO is full.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| push_data  | **Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_data` port is used to input data into the FIFO. It represents the data being pushed into the FIFO when a valid push operation occurs.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_data` port by driving it with the data they wish to store in the FIFO. This interaction occurs in conjunction with the `push_valid` signal, which indicates when the data on `push_data` is valid and ready to be pushed into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted (set to 1) and `push_ready` is also asserted, the data present on `push_data` is successfully written into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The width of `push_data` is determined by the `Width` parameter, meaning it can hold a data word of `Width` bits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_valid` is not asserted, the data on `push_data` is ignored, and no push operation occurs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The FIFO's ability to accept new data is also influenced by the `full` signal; if the FIFO is full, `push_ready` will be deasserted, preventing new data from being pushed.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `push_data` is influenced by the `EnableBypass` parameter. If bypass is enabled and the FIFO is empty, data can be pushed directly to the pop interface, potentially reducing latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The stability of `push_data` during backpressure conditions can be asserted or covered based on the `EnableAssertPushDataStability` parameter, ensuring data integrity when the FIFO cannot accept new data. |
| pop_ready  | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_ready` port indicates the readiness of the consumer to accept data from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules set the `pop_ready` signal to high (1) when they are ready to receive data from the FIFO. This signal is typically driven by the downstream logic that consumes the data.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is high (1) and `pop_valid` is also high (1), data is successfully transferred from the FIFO to the consumer. This handshake allows the FIFO to release data to the consumer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is low (0), even if `pop_valid` is high (1), the data transfer does not occur, and the FIFO holds the data until `pop_ready` goes high (1) again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_ready` signal should be managed by the consumer to control the flow of data and prevent overflow or underflow conditions.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In scenarios where `EnableBypass` is set to 1, if the FIFO is empty and `pop_ready` is high (1), the FIFO can immediately pass data from `push_data` to `pop_data` without waiting for it to be stored in the internal RAM, provided `push_valid` is also high (1). This results in zero-cycle latency for data transfer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `pop_ready` and `pop_valid` is crucial for maintaining the ready-valid handshake protocol, ensuring data integrity and synchronization between producer and consumer.                                                                                                                     |

| push_ready | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_ready` port indicates whether the FIFO is ready to accept new data on the push interface.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_ready` port by checking its value before attempting to send data to the FIFO. If `push_ready` is high, the module can assert `push_valid` and provide data on `push_data`.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_ready` is high (1), the FIFO is ready to accept new data. The user can assert `push_valid` and provide data on `push_data`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_ready` is low (0), the FIFO cannot accept new data, and the user should wait until `push_ready` becomes high before asserting `push_valid`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_ready` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is not ready to accept data until it is properly initialized.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `push_ready` is influenced by the FIFO's internal state, such as whether it is full or has available slots (`slots` and `slots_next`).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `EnableBypass` parameter can affect the timing and conditions under which `push_ready` is asserted, particularly when the FIFO is empty and bypass mode is enabled, potentially allowing immediate data acceptance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| pop_valid  | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_valid` port indicates whether valid data is available to be read from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `pop_valid` port by checking its value to determine if the data on the `pop_data` port is valid and ready to be consumed. This is typically used in conjunction with the `pop_ready` signal to manage data flow.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_valid` = 0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_valid` is 1, it signifies that the data on `pop_data` is valid and can be read by the consumer if `pop_ready` is also asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is 0, `pop_valid` remains 1, indicating that the data is still valid and waiting to be consumed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is 1 and `pop_valid` is 1, the data is consumed, and `pop_valid` may transition to 0 in the next cycle if no new data is available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `pop_valid` is influenced by the `EnableBypass` and `RegisterPopOutputs` parameters, which can affect the latency and timing of when data becomes valid.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `EnableBypass` is set to 1, `pop_valid` can become 1 immediately if the FIFO is empty and new data is pushed, allowing for zero-cycle latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `RegisterPopOutputs` is set to 1, `pop_valid` may have an additional cycle of latency, as data is registered before being presented as valid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_valid` is closely tied to the FIFO's internal state, such as `empty` and `items`, which track the availability of data within the FIFO.                                                                                                                  |
| pop_data   | **Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_data` port outputs the data from the FIFO when a valid pop operation occurs.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `pop_data` port by reading the data when `pop_valid` is asserted, indicating that the data is ready to be consumed. The data width is determined by the `Width` parameter.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high, `pop_data` presents the data from the FIFO for consumption.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableBypass` is set to 1 and the FIFO is empty, `pop_data` can directly reflect `push_data` when `push_valid` is high, allowing for zero-cycle latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `RegisterPopOutputs` is set to 1, `pop_data` is registered, introducing an additional cycle of latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_data` = 0, as the FIFO is empty and no valid data is available.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `EnableBypass` is enabled, `pop_data` can immediately reflect incoming `push_data` if the FIFO is empty, providing a cut-through path that reduces latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_data` is influenced by the `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter, which can add a register stage to improve timing at the cost of increased latency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| full       | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `full` port indicates whether the FIFO is currently full, meaning it cannot accept any more data until space is freed.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `full` port by monitoring its status to determine if they can push new data into the FIFO. If `full` is asserted (logic high), the FIFO is full, and no new data should be pushed.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `full` is asserted, the FIFO has reached its maximum capacity (`Depth`), and `push_ready` will be deasserted, indicating that no more data can be accepted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `full` is deasserted, there is space available in the FIFO, and `push_ready` will be asserted, allowing new data to be pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `full` = 0, indicating the FIFO is empty and ready to accept data.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `full` signal is directly influenced by the `Depth` parameter, which defines the maximum number of entries the FIFO can hold.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `full` can be affected by the `EnableBypass` parameter. If bypass is enabled, the FIFO may appear less full than it actually is, as data can be directly passed from `push_data` to `pop_data` without occupying a slot in the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `full` signal is also related to the `slots` and `slots_next` signals, which provide more granular information about the number of available slots in the FIFO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| full_next  | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `full_next` port indicates whether the FIFO will be full in the next clock cycle based on the current operations.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `full_next` signal to anticipate when the FIFO will be full, allowing them to manage data flow and prevent overflow conditions.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, indicating a successful push operation, `full_next` will be set to 1 if this operation will cause the FIFO to reach its full capacity in the next cycle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the FIFO is not at full capacity and no push operation is occurring, `full_next` will remain 0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `full_next` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is not expected to be full immediately after a reset.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In scenarios where `EnableBypass` is set to 1, the FIFO can bypass the RAM when empty, potentially affecting the timing of when `full_next` transitions to 1.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `full_next` signal provides a predictive indication, allowing for proactive management of data flow, especially in systems where backpressure needs to be minimized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| slots      | **Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `slots` port indicates the number of available slots in the FIFO for new data entries.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `slots` port to determine how many additional data entries can be pushed into the FIFO without causing overflow. This information is crucial for managing data flow and preventing data loss due to overflow.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `slots` = `Depth`, indicating that the FIFO is empty and all slots are available for new data entries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, indicating a successful push operation, the value of `slots` decreases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, when `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high, indicating a successful pop operation, the value of `slots` increases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `slots` should always be between 0 and `Depth`, inclusive.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `slots` equals 0, the FIFO is full, and no additional data can be pushed until a pop operation occurs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `slots` equals `Depth`, the FIFO is empty, and the `empty` signal is asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `slots` is influenced by the `EnableBypass` parameter. If bypass is enabled, the FIFO can exhibit a cut-through behavior, potentially affecting how quickly `slots` updates in response to push and pop operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| slots_next | **Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `slots_next` port indicates the number of available slots in the FIFO for the next clock cycle.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `slots_next` port to determine how many entries can be pushed into the FIFO in the upcoming cycle. This information can be used to manage data flow and prevent overflow conditions.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `slots_next` = Depth, indicating that all slots are available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is high and `push_ready` is also high, indicating a successful push operation, `slots_next` decreases by one, reflecting the reduced number of available slots.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If no push occurs (either `push_valid` is low or `push_ready` is low), `slots_next` remains unchanged.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is high and `pop_valid` is also high, indicating a successful pop operation, `slots_next` increases by one, reflecting the increased number of available slots.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If no pop occurs (either `pop_ready` is low or `pop_valid` is low), `slots_next` remains unchanged.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In scenarios where the FIFO is full (`full` is high), `slots_next` will be zero, indicating no available slots for new data until a pop operation occurs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, when the FIFO is empty (`empty` is high), `slots_next` will be equal to `Depth`, indicating all slots are available for new data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `slots_next` is directly influenced by the `EnableBypass` parameter. If bypass is enabled, the FIFO can potentially have a cut-through path, affecting how quickly slots become available after a pop operation. |
| empty      | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `empty` port indicates whether the FIFO is currently empty, meaning there are no items available to be read.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `empty` port to determine if there are any items available in the FIFO to be read. This signal can be used to control the flow of data, ensuring that read operations are only attempted when the FIFO is not empty.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `empty` is high (1), it signifies that the FIFO contains no items, and `pop_valid` will be low (0), indicating that no valid data is available for popping.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `empty` is low (0), it indicates that there are items in the FIFO, and `pop_valid` may be high (1) if `pop_ready` is also high, allowing data to be read.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `empty` = 1, indicating that the FIFO starts in an empty state.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `empty` signal transitions from high to low when the first item is pushed into the FIFO, provided that `push_valid` is high and `push_ready` is also high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, `empty` transitions from low to high when the last item is popped from the FIFO, provided that `pop_ready` is high and `pop_valid` is also high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `empty` is influenced by the `Depth` parameter, as a larger depth allows more items to be stored before the FIFO becomes non-empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Depth                          | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `Depth` parameter defines the number of entries in the FIFO, determining its storage capacity. It influences how many data items can be stored simultaneously between the push and pop operations. Users interact with this parameter to configure the FIFO's ability to handle varying amounts of data, ensuring it can accommodate the expected data flow in their specific application. For example, a larger `Depth` allows for more data to be buffered, which is useful in scenarios with high data burst rates or when there is potential for backpressure. Conversely, a smaller `Depth` might be chosen for applications with limited space or lower data throughput requirements.                                                                                                                  |
| Width                          | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `Width` parameter defines the bit-width of each data entry within the FIFO. It determines how many bits are used to represent each piece of data that is pushed into or popped from the FIFO. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to match the size of the data they intend to store and transfer through the FIFO. For example, if a user needs to handle 32-bit data words, they would configure the `Width` parameter accordingly. This parameter ensures that the FIFO can accommodate the specific data size requirements of the user's application, allowing for seamless data handling and transfer between different stages of a digital design.                                                                                                                                        |
| EnableBypass                   | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:<br>The `EnableBypass` parameter controls the data flow path within the FIFO design. When enabled, it allows data to bypass the internal RAM when the FIFO is empty, facilitating immediate transfer from `push_data` to `pop_data` with zero-cycle latency. This configuration is beneficial for minimizing latency in scenarios where quick data propagation is critical. Conversely, when disabled, all data must pass through the internal RAM, introducing a one-cycle latency but improving timing by eliminating direct combinational paths between the push and pop interfaces. This setting is useful in designs where timing closure is a priority over minimal latency.                                                                                                                                    |
| RegisterPopOutputs             | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter is used to control the latency and timing characteristics of the FIFO's pop interface. When enabled, it ensures that the `pop_valid` and `pop_data` signals are always sourced from a register, which can improve the timing of paths dependent on these signals. This comes at the cost of an additional cycle of cut-through latency. For example, if a user requires stable and predictable timing for the `pop_valid` and `pop_data` signals, enabling this parameter would be beneficial. Conversely, if minimizing latency is a priority, the user might choose to disable it, allowing `pop_valid` and `pop_data` to be directly influenced by `push_valid` and the internal RAM data, provided bypass is enabled.                                                     |
| FlopRamDepthTiles              | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamDepthTiles` parameter is used to configure the internal organization of the FIFO's memory structure. It determines how the depth of the FIFO is divided into smaller, manageable sections or "tiles." This tiling can optimize memory access patterns and improve performance by allowing parallel processing of data within the FIFO. Users can adjust this parameter to match the specific requirements of their design, such as balancing memory access speed and resource utilization. By setting `FlopRamDepthTiles`, users can influence how the FIFO handles data storage and retrieval, potentially impacting the overall efficiency and timing of the design.                                                                                                                               |
| FlopRamWidthTiles              | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamWidthTiles` parameter determines the number of tiles along the width (data) dimension of the FIFO's internal flop-RAM. It must be at least 1 and should evenly divide the `Width` parameter. This parameter allows users to configure the internal data storage structure of the FIFO, optimizing for specific design requirements such as data width partitioning. By adjusting `FlopRamWidthTiles`, users can influence how data is organized and accessed within the FIFO, potentially impacting performance and resource utilization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| FlopRamAddressDepthStages      | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamAddressDepthStages` parameter is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages along the write and read address paths within the FIFO's depth dimension. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the FIFO by inserting additional pipeline stages, which can help in meeting timing constraints in designs with critical paths. By increasing the number of stages, users can improve the timing performance at the cost of increased latency. This parameter is particularly useful in scenarios where the FIFO needs to operate at high frequencies, and the address path timing needs to be optimized to avoid setup and hold time violations.                                                                                                             |
| FlopRamReadDataDepthStages     | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamReadDataDepthStages` parameter is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages along the read data path in the depth dimension of the FIFO. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the FIFO by inserting additional pipeline stages, which can help in meeting timing constraints in designs with critical paths. By increasing the number of stages, users can improve the timing performance at the cost of additional latency. This parameter is particularly useful in scenarios where the read data path needs to be optimized for better timing closure without affecting the overall functionality of the FIFO.                                                                                                                                      |
| FlopRamReadDataWidthStages     | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamReadDataWidthStages` parameter is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages along the read data path in the width dimension of the FIFO. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the FIFO by inserting additional pipeline stages, which can help meet specific timing requirements or improve data stability during read operations. By increasing the number of stages, users can potentially reduce the critical path delay associated with reading data, thereby enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the design in scenarios where data width is a significant factor.                                                                                                                                                               |
| EnableCoverPushBackpressure    | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableCoverPushBackpressure` parameter is used to control the coverage of backpressure scenarios on the push side of the FIFO. When enabled, it ensures that the design accounts for situations where the push interface experiences backpressure, meaning that the FIFO cannot accept new data because it is full or unable to process incoming data. This parameter is crucial for verifying that the FIFO can handle such conditions without data loss or corruption. Users can interact with this parameter to ensure that their design is robust against backpressure, which is a common scenario in pipeline architectures. For example, enabling this parameter would help verify that the FIFO correctly signals when it cannot accept more data, allowing upstream logic to respond appropriately. |
| EnableAssertPushValidStability | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:<br>The `EnableAssertPushValidStability` parameter is used to control the stability of the `push_valid` signal during backpressure conditions. When enabled, it ensures that the `push_valid` signal remains stable and does not change while the FIFO is experiencing backpressure, which occurs when the `push_ready` signal is de-asserted. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing data loss or corruption in scenarios where the FIFO cannot accept new data. Users can configure this parameter to assert the stability of `push_valid`, ensuring that the design behaves predictably under backpressure. This is particularly useful in systems where data consistency is critical, and any fluctuation in the `push_valid` signal could lead to erroneous data processing.              |
| EnableAssertPushDataStability  | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableAssertPushDataStability` parameter is used to control the stability of the `push_data` signal when the FIFO experiences backpressure. When enabled, it ensures that `push_data` remains stable and unchanged during backpressure conditions, which occurs when `push_valid` is asserted but `push_ready` is not. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity in scenarios where the FIFO cannot accept new data immediately. For example, if a user sets this parameter, they can expect that once `push_valid` is asserted, the data being pushed will not change until it is successfully written into the FIFO. This parameter is particularly useful in designs where data consistency is critical during periods of backpressure.                                                             |
| EnableAssertFinalNotValid      | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableAssertFinalNotValid` parameter is used to ensure that the FIFO is empty and no valid bits are asserted at the end of a test. When enabled, it asserts that the FIFO has been completely emptied, which is useful for verifying that all data has been processed and no residual data remains in the FIFO. This parameter is particularly important for test environments where confirming the complete processing of data is critical. It helps users validate the design's behavior by ensuring that the FIFO's state is as expected at the conclusion of operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| CountWidth                     | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:<br>The `CountWidth` parameter determines the bit-width required to represent the count of entries in the FIFO, ranging from 0 to the maximum depth plus one. It is crucial for tracking the number of occupied slots (`slots`, `slots_next`) and available items (`items`, `items_next`) within the FIFO. This parameter ensures that the design can accurately manage and report the status of the FIFO's capacity, allowing users to understand how full or empty the FIFO is at any given time. By calculating the bit-width based on the `Depth` parameter, `CountWidth` facilitates efficient storage and retrieval operations, ensuring that the FIFO operates correctly within its configured capacity.                                                                                                       |

| Data Transfer with Bypass and Registration | The design allows for efficient data transfer within the FIFO buffer, with options for bypassing and output registration to optimize performance. The control signals `push_valid`, `push_data`, and `pop_ready` are crucial for managing the data flow. When the bypass mode is enabled (`EnableBypass` set to 1) and the FIFO is empty, data can be transferred directly from the `push_data` input to the `pop_data` output with zero latency. If output registration is enabled, the data is registered before being available on `pop_data`, introducing a one-cycle latency. The design ensures that `push_ready` is asserted when the FIFO can accept new data, and `pop_valid` is asserted when valid data is available for popping. The FIFO status flags, including `full`, `full_next`, `slots`, `slots_next`, `empty`, `empty_next`, `items`, and `items_next`, are continuously updated to reflect the current and next state of the FIFO. The operational sequence involves asserting `push_valid` with data on `push_data`, monitoring `push_ready` for data acceptance, and asserting `pop_ready` to receive data, while observing `pop_valid` for data availability. |
| Handling Backpressure and Stability        | The design effectively manages backpressure conditions and ensures the stability of push signals to maintain reliable operation. Backpressure is handled using the `push_valid` and `push_ready` signals, particularly when the FIFO is full (`full` is asserted). During backpressure, `push_ready` is deasserted, preventing new data from being pushed into the FIFO. This mechanism ensures that `push_valid` and `push_data` remain stable and unchanged while `push_ready` is deasserted, maintaining data integrity. The design asserts the `full` and `full_next` signals based on the FIFO's occupancy and updates the `slots` and `slots_next` signals accordingly. The operational sequence involves asserting `push_valid`, monitoring the `full` and `push_ready` signals, and ensuring that `push_valid` and `push_data` remain stable when `push_ready` is deasserted, effectively managing backpressure and ensuring stable operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
