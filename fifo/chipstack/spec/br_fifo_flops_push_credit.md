| push_credit_stall    | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_credit_stall` port is used to control the flow of data into the FIFO by indicating when the push operation should be stalled.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_credit_stall` port by setting it to a logic high or low. When high, it signals the FIFO to stall the acceptance of new data on the push interface.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_credit_stall` is set to logic high, the FIFO will not accept new data, even if `push_valid` is asserted. This prevents the FIFO from receiving data when it cannot process it, such as when it is full or when backpressure is applied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_credit_stall` is set to logic low, the FIFO is allowed to accept new data if `push_valid` is also asserted and there is available space in the FIFO.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_credit_stall` port can be used in conjunction with `push_valid` to manage flow control dynamically. For example, if the FIFO is nearing its capacity, `push_credit_stall` can be asserted to prevent overflow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_credit_stall` and other control signals like `full` and `slots` can be used to implement complex flow control mechanisms in a larger system, ensuring data integrity and preventing data loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| push_valid           | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_valid` port indicates when valid data is being pushed into the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules assert `push_valid` to signal that the data present on `push_data` is valid and should be written into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted (logic high), it indicates that the data on `push_data` is ready to be pushed into the FIFO, provided that `push_credit_stall` is not asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_credit_stall` is asserted, the push operation is stalled, and the data will not be written into the FIFO, even if `push_valid` is high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is deasserted (logic low), it indicates that there is no valid data to be pushed into the FIFO.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In scenarios where `EnableBypass` is set to 1 and the FIFO is empty, asserting `push_valid` can lead to immediate availability of data at the pop interface, minimizing latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_valid` and `push_credit_stall` is crucial for managing flow control and preventing data loss or overflow in the FIFO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| push_data            | **Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_data` port is used to input data into the FIFO for storage and eventual retrieval.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_data` port by driving it with data values they wish to store in the FIFO. This interaction typically occurs in conjunction with asserting the `push_valid` signal to indicate that the data on `push_data` is valid and ready to be pushed into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_credit_stall` is not asserted, the data present on `push_data` is captured and stored in the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The width of the data is determined by the `Width` parameter, meaning `push_data` can hold values ranging from 0 to (2^{ ext{Width}} - 1).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `Width` is set to 8, `push_data` can hold values from 0 to 255.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_credit_stall` is asserted, the data on `push_data` is not accepted, even if `push_valid` is asserted.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `push_data` is influenced by the `EnableBypass` parameter. If bypass is enabled and the FIFO is empty, data can be directly forwarded to the pop interface, potentially reducing latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data on `push_data` is only relevant when `push_valid` is asserted; otherwise, the data is ignored by the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction with `push_data` is synchronous with the `clk` signal, meaning data is captured on the rising edge of `clk` when conditions for a valid push are met. |
| pop_ready            | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_ready` port indicates the readiness of the receiving side to accept data from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules set the `pop_ready` signal to high (logic 1) when they are ready to receive data from the FIFO. This interaction is crucial for controlling the flow of data out of the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is high and `pop_valid` is also high, data is successfully transferred from the FIFO to the receiving module, and `pop_data` contains valid data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is low, even if `pop_valid` is high, the data transfer does not occur, and the FIFO retains the data for the next cycle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The combination of `pop_ready` and `pop_valid` being high allows for the synchronization of data transfer, ensuring that data is only popped when the receiving side is prepared to handle it.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `pop_ready` and `pop_valid` can create backpressure on the FIFO. If `pop_ready` remains low for multiple cycles, it can cause the FIFO to fill up, potentially leading to a situation where `full` becomes high, indicating that no more data can be pushed into the FIFO until space is made available by popping data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In scenarios where `EnableBypass` is set to 1, the latency from push to pop can be minimized, but the readiness indicated by `pop_ready` still governs whether data is actually transferred out of the FIFO.                                                               |
| credit_initial_push  | **Type:** `logic[CreditWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `credit_initial_push` port is used to set the initial number of credits available for push operations in the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `credit_initial_push` port by providing a value that determines the starting credit count for the FIFO. This value is used to manage how many push operations can be performed before the FIFO becomes full.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When the system is initialized, the value on `credit_initial_push` sets the initial credit count.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `credit_initial_push` is set to a value equal to `Depth`, it allows the FIFO to be fully utilized from the start.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `credit_initial_push` is set to a lower value, it restricts the number of initial push operations, potentially leaving some FIFO slots unused until additional credits are granted.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Setting `credit_initial_push` to a value greater than `Depth` is not meaningful, as the FIFO cannot hold more entries than its depth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The initial credit value can be used strategically to control the flow of data into the FIFO, especially in systems where backpressure or flow control is critical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| credit_withhold_push | **Type:** `logic[CreditWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `credit_withhold_push` port is used to specify the number of credits to be withheld from the available push credits in the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with this port by setting its value to control the number of credits that should not be used for push operations. This can be useful for managing flow control and ensuring that the FIFO does not become overfilled.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `credit_withhold_push` is set to a non-zero value, the number of available credits for push operations (`credit_available_push`) is reduced by the specified amount.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `credit_initial_push` is 10 and `credit_withhold_push` is set to 3, the effective credits available for pushing data into the FIFO would be 7.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `credit_withhold_push` is set to 0, all initial credits are available for use, assuming no other constraints are applied.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Adjusting `credit_withhold_push` dynamically can be used to throttle the rate of data being pushed into the FIFO, which can be particularly useful in scenarios where downstream modules are experiencing backpressure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `credit_withhold_push` can be changed on-the-fly to adapt to varying conditions in the system, providing a flexible mechanism for flow control.                                                                                                                                                                      |

| push_receiver_in_reset | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_receiver_in_reset` port indicates whether the push receiver side of the FIFO is in a reset state.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with this port by monitoring its state to determine if the push receiver is currently in reset. This can be used to synchronize or control the flow of data into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When the FIFO is in a reset state, `push_receiver_in_reset` is expected to be asserted (logic high), indicating that the push receiver is not ready to accept data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When the FIFO is not in a reset state, `push_receiver_in_reset` is expected to be deasserted (logic low), indicating that the push receiver is ready to accept data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_receiver_in_reset` = 0 (assuming it is not explicitly assigned a value during reset).<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The state of `push_receiver_in_reset` can affect the flow control of the FIFO. If it remains asserted, it may prevent data from being pushed into the FIFO, regardless of the state of other control signals like `push_valid` or `push_credit_stall`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| push_credit            | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_credit` port indicates the availability of credit for pushing data into the FIFO, allowing the sender to know when it can send more data.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_credit` port by monitoring its state to determine if they can proceed with sending data. When `push_credit` is asserted, it signals that the FIFO can accept more data.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_credit` is high, it indicates that there is sufficient credit available for the sender to push data into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_credit_stall` is asserted, `push_credit` may be de-asserted, indicating that the sender should pause data transmission.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The availability of credit is influenced by the parameters `credit_initial_push` and `credit_withhold_push`, which define the initial and withheld credits, respectively.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_credit` = 0, indicating that no credit is available until the system is initialized and credits are allocated.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `push_credit` is closely tied to the FIFO's credit management system, which dynamically adjusts based on the current state of the FIFO and the credit parameters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_credit` and `push_credit_stall` can lead to complex flow control scenarios, especially when the FIFO is near capacity or when `EnableBypass` is configured to alter the FIFO's latency characteristics.                                                                                                        |
| pop_valid              | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_valid` indicates whether the data available on the `pop_data` port is valid and can be consumed by the downstream logic.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor `pop_valid` to determine when valid data is available to be read from the FIFO. When `pop_valid` is asserted, the data on `pop_data` is ready for processing.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_valid = 0`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and there is valid data in the FIFO, `pop_valid` is asserted, indicating that the data on `pop_data` is valid and can be read.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the FIFO is empty (`empty = 1`), `pop_valid` remains deasserted, indicating no valid data is available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In bypass mode (`EnableBypass = 1`), `pop_valid` can be asserted immediately if `push_valid` is asserted and the FIFO is empty, allowing for zero-cycle latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `RegisterPopOutputs = 1`, `pop_valid` may have an additional cycle of latency due to the registered output.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `pop_valid` can transition from deasserted to asserted in a single cycle when data becomes available, provided `pop_ready` is high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_valid` is influenced by the `EnableBypass` parameter, which can reduce latency by allowing immediate data forwarding when the FIFO is empty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| pop_data               | **Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_data` serves as the output data port for the FIFO, providing the data element that is being read from the FIFO when a pop operation is performed.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with `pop_data` by reading the data available on this port when `pop_valid` is asserted, indicating that valid data is present and can be consumed.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high, `pop_data` presents the data element at the front of the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableBypass` is set to 1 and the FIFO is empty, `pop_data` can directly reflect the `push_data` when `push_valid` is asserted, allowing for zero-cycle latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableBypass` is set to 0, `pop_data` will only reflect data after it has been stored in the FIFO, introducing a one-cycle latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_data` = 0, as the FIFO is empty and no valid data is available.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value on `pop_data` can change immediately if `EnableBypass` is enabled and the FIFO is empty, allowing for immediate data forwarding from `push_data`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_data` is influenced by the `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter, which, if set to 1, ensures that `pop_data` is always driven from a register, potentially adding an additional cycle of latency but improving timing closure.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| full                   | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `full` port indicates whether the FIFO is currently full, meaning it cannot accept any more data until space is freed.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `full` signal to determine if they can push more data into the FIFO. If `full` is asserted, the module should refrain from sending additional data until the signal is deasserted.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `full` is high, the FIFO has reached its maximum capacity (`Depth` entries), and no additional data can be pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `full` is low, there is available space in the FIFO for new data to be pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `full` = 0, indicating the FIFO is empty and can accept new data.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `full` signal is directly influenced by the `push_valid` and `pop_ready` signals. If `push_valid` is asserted while `full` is low, the FIFO will accept data, potentially causing `full` to become high if the FIFO reaches capacity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `full` signal may toggle between high and low as data is pushed into and popped from the FIFO, reflecting the dynamic nature of the FIFO's capacity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| full_next              | **Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `full_next` port indicates whether the FIFO will be full in the next clock cycle based on current operations.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `full_next` signal to anticipate if the FIFO will be full in the next cycle, allowing them to manage data flow accordingly.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and the FIFO is not currently full, `full_next` will be set to 1 if the current operation will fill the FIFO to its maximum capacity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the FIFO is already full or `push_credit_stall` is asserted, `full_next` remains 1, indicating no additional data can be pushed in the next cycle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high, indicating a successful pop operation, `full_next` may transition to 0 if the FIFO will no longer be full after the pop.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `full_next` = 0, indicating the FIFO is not full in the next cycle.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `full_next` provides a predictive indication of the FIFO's state, allowing upstream logic to prepare for potential backpressure by halting data pushes if `full_next` is 1.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `full_next` is influenced by the `EnableBypass` parameter, which can affect how quickly the FIFO transitions between states.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Depth                      | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `Depth` parameter defines the number of entries in the FIFO, determining its storage capacity. It influences how many data items can be stored in the FIFO at any given time. Users interact with this parameter to configure the FIFO's ability to handle varying amounts of data, which is crucial for managing data flow and preventing overflow in systems with fluctuating data rates. The parameter must be set to a minimum value to ensure proper functionality, and it directly affects the `slots`, `slots_next`, `full`, `full_next`, `empty`, and `empty_next` signals, which indicate the current and next state of the FIFO's occupancy.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Width                      | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `Width` parameter defines the bit-width of each data entry within the FIFO. It determines how many bits are used to represent each piece of data that is pushed into or popped from the FIFO. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to match the size of the data they intend to store and transfer through the FIFO. For example, if the data being handled is 32 bits wide, the `Width` parameter should be set accordingly to accommodate the entire data word. This parameter ensures that the FIFO can handle data of varying sizes, providing flexibility to adapt to different data width requirements in various applications.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| EnableBypass               | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableBypass` parameter determines the data flow path within the FIFO design. When enabled, it allows data to bypass the internal RAM when the FIFO is empty, facilitating immediate data transfer from the push interface to the pop interface. This results in zero-cycle latency, enhancing throughput at the cost of potential timing challenges due to the combinational path. Conversely, when disabled, all data must pass through the internal RAM, introducing a one-cycle latency but improving timing closure by eliminating direct combinational paths between push and pop interfaces. This configuration is crucial for users needing to balance between latency and timing constraints in their design.                                                                                                                   |
| MaxCredit                  | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `MaxCredit` parameter defines the maximum allowable credit for the internal credit counter of the FIFO. It ensures that the credit counter can accommodate at least the number of entries specified by `Depth`. This parameter is crucial for managing the flow control between the push and pop interfaces, as it dictates the maximum number of pushes that can be accepted before requiring a pop operation to free up space. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to align with their design's credit management strategy, ensuring that the FIFO operates efficiently without exceeding its capacity. The parameter is typically set to match `Depth` to maintain a balance between resource usage and performance, but it can be adjusted for consistency across a design if a uniform credit counter width is desired. |
| RegisterPushOutputs        | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `RegisterPushOutputs` parameter is used to control the timing of the `push_credit` signal in the FIFO design. When set, it introduces an additional retiming stage to the `push_credit` signal, ensuring it is driven directly from a register. This adjustment can help improve the timing of the credit loop by adding a cycle of latency, which may be beneficial in designs where timing closure is challenging. Users can enable this parameter to achieve more predictable and stable timing characteristics at the expense of an extra cycle of latency in the credit loop.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| RegisterPopOutputs         | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter is used to control the timing and latency characteristics of the FIFO's pop interface. When enabled, it ensures that the `pop_valid` and `pop_data` signals are driven directly from a register, which can improve the timing of paths dependent on the pop interface. This comes at the cost of an additional cycle of cut-through latency. In contrast, when disabled, these signals may come directly from the `push_valid` signal (if bypass is enabled) or from the internal RAM, allowing for potentially lower latency but with less favorable timing characteristics. This parameter allows users to balance between achieving better timing closure and minimizing latency based on their specific design requirements.                                                                           |
| FlopRamDepthTiles          | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamDepthTiles` parameter is used to configure the internal memory structure of the FIFO design. It determines how the depth of the memory is divided into smaller, manageable sections or "tiles." This tiling can help optimize memory access patterns and improve performance by allowing parallel access to different sections of the memory. Users can adjust this parameter to match the specific requirements of their design, such as balancing memory access speed and resource utilization. By configuring `FlopRamDepthTiles`, users can ensure that the FIFO efficiently handles data storage and retrieval, especially in designs with specific depth requirements.                                                                                                                                                      |
| FlopRamWidthTiles          | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamWidthTiles` parameter is used to configure the number of tiles along the width (data) dimension of the internal flop-RAM within the FIFO design. This parameter allows users to partition the data width into multiple tiles, which can be useful for optimizing the design for specific hardware implementations or for meeting certain timing requirements. By adjusting this parameter, users can control how the data is organized and accessed within the FIFO, potentially improving data throughput or reducing latency in certain scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| FlopRamAddressDepthStages  | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamAddressDepthStages` parameter is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages inserted along the write and read address paths in the depth dimension of the FIFO's internal RAM. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the FIFO by adding pipeline stages, which can help meet timing requirements in designs with critical paths. By increasing the number of stages, users can improve the timing performance at the cost of additional latency. This parameter is particularly useful in scenarios where the FIFO is part of a larger design with stringent timing constraints, allowing for more flexibility in achieving timing closure.                                                                                                                                           |
| FlopRamReadDataDepthStages | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamReadDataDepthStages` parameter is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages inserted along the read data path in the depth dimension of the FIFO's internal RAM. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the FIFO by adding latency to the read data path, which can help meet timing constraints in designs with critical paths. By increasing the number of stages, users can improve the timing closure at the expense of additional latency in data retrieval. This parameter is particularly useful in scenarios where the design requires balancing between performance and timing requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| FlopRamReadDataWidthStages | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `FlopRamReadDataWidthStages` parameter is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages along the read data path in the width dimension of the FIFO's internal flop-RAM. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the design by adding additional stages, which can help meet timing requirements by reducing the critical path length. For example, if the design is experiencing timing issues due to the width of the data being read, increasing the number of stages can help alleviate these issues by breaking down the data path into smaller, more manageable segments. This parameter is particularly useful in designs where the width of the data is large, and timing closure is challenging.                                                                                          |
| EnableAssertFinalNotValid  | **Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>The `EnableAssertFinalNotValid` parameter is used to ensure that the FIFO is empty and no valid bits are asserted at the end of a test. When enabled, it adds an assertion check that verifies the FIFO's state at the conclusion of operations, ensuring that all data has been correctly processed and no residual data remains. This parameter is particularly useful for validation and debugging, as it helps confirm that the FIFO has been fully drained and is in a reset state, preventing potential data integrity issues in subsequent operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| CountWidth                 | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>`CountWidth` is a configuration parameter that determines the bit-width required to represent the number of entries in the FIFO, ranging from 0 to `Depth`. It is calculated using the logarithm base 2 of `Depth + 1`, ensuring that the counter can accurately track the number of occupied slots in the FIFO. This parameter is crucial for users to understand the capacity and current utilization of the FIFO, allowing them to manage data flow effectively. For example, if `Depth` is set to a higher value, `CountWidth` will increase accordingly, enabling the FIFO to handle a larger number of entries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| CreditWidth                | **Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**: <br>`CreditWidth` determines the bit-width of the credit counter used in the FIFO design. It is crucial for managing the flow control between the push and pop interfaces by tracking the number of available credits. This parameter ensures that the credit counter can accommodate the maximum number of credits, which is influenced by the `MaxCredit` parameter. Users interact with this parameter indirectly by setting `MaxCredit`, which in turn affects `CreditWidth`. The design automatically calculates `CreditWidth` to ensure it is sufficient to represent all possible credit values, thus preventing overflow and ensuring reliable operation. This parameter is essential for maintaining synchronization and preventing data loss or overflow in scenarios where the FIFO is used in a pipeline with varying data rates.     |

| Data Transfer with Credit Management | The design performs a sequence of push and pop operations while managing credits and ensuring data integrity. It uses a credit-based flow control mechanism to manage data transfer on the push interface. The testbench sets `credit_initial_push` to initialize the credit counter and `credit_withhold_push` to dynamically withhold credits. The testbench asserts `push_valid` to indicate valid data is present on `push_data`. The design monitors `push_credit_stall` to determine if it can release credits. If `push_credit_stall` is deasserted and credits are available, the design asserts `push_credit` to release credits. The design updates `credit_count_push` and `credit_available_push` based on the credit transactions. The design asserts `pop_valid` and transfers `push_data` to `pop_data` when credits are available. The testbench asserts `pop_ready` to indicate readiness to receive data. The design checks if data is available for popping and asserts `pop_valid` to indicate valid data is present on the pop interface. The design transfers the data to `pop_data` and updates `empty`, `empty_next`, `items`, and `items_next` based on the pop operations. The design updates `full`, `full_next`, `slots`, and `slots_next` based on the push and pop operations. The sequence ensures that data is transferred efficiently while maintaining accurate status flags for the FIFO's state. |
