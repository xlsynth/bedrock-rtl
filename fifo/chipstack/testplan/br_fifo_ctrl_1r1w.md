|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|BasicPushPopFunctionality|Check that the FIFO correctly handles data push until full and data pop until empty, verifying the behavior of `push_valid`, `push_ready`, `pop_valid`, and `pop_ready` signals.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `rst` to reset the FIFO, ensuring it is empty, and then deasserts `rst` to begin normal operation. The testbench monitors the `empty` signal and waits for it to be asserted by the design, confirming the FIFO is empty.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_valid` and drives a random value from `push_data_sequence` on `push_data` with a width of `Width` bits. The testbench monitors `push_ready` and waits for it to be asserted by the design, indicating the FIFO is ready to accept data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench continues to assert `push_valid` and drive new random values from `push_data_sequence` on `push_data` until `push_ready` is deasserted by the design, indicating the FIFO is full. The testbench waits for the `full` signal to be asserted by the design, confirming the FIFO is full.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` to indicate readiness to receive data. The testbench monitors `pop_valid` and waits for it to be asserted by the design, indicating valid data is available on `pop_data`.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench continues to assert `pop_ready` and read data from `pop_data` until `pop_valid` is deasserted by the design, indicating the FIFO is empty. The testbench waits for the `empty` signal to be asserted by the design, confirming the FIFO is empty.  <br><br>|
|BypassModeVerification|Check that the bypass mode functionality allows data to be transferred directly from the push interface to the pop interface with zero-cycle latency when the FIFO is empty.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench sets the `EnableBypass` parameter to 1 to enable bypass mode.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `rst` to reset the FIFO and then deasserts it to begin normal operation.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_valid` and drives data on `push_data` with a width specified by `Width`. The testbench monitors `empty` and waits for the design to assert it, indicating the FIFO is empty.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` to indicate readiness to receive data. The testbench monitors `pop_valid` and waits for the design to assert it, indicating data is available immediately due to bypass mode.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench waits for the design to drive data on `pop_data` and verifies it matches the data driven on `push_data`, confirming zero-cycle latency.  <br><br>|
|BackpressureHandling|Check that the FIFO correctly handles backpressure by deasserting `push_ready` when the FIFO is full, preventing further data from being pushed.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `rst` to reset the FIFO and initializes `full_next` to 0. The testbench then deasserts `rst` to begin normal operation.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_valid` and provides data on `push_data`. It monitors `push_ready` and waits for the design to assert `push_ready`, indicating the FIFO is ready to accept data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench continues to assert `push_valid` and provide new data on `push_data` while monitoring `full_next`. If `full_next` transitions to 1, the testbench anticipates that the FIFO will be full in the next cycle.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Once `full_next` is 1, the testbench waits for the design to deassert `push_ready`, confirming that the FIFO is full.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench continues to assert `push_valid` and monitors `push_ready` to ensure it remains deasserted, confirming that backpressure is correctly handled by the design.  <br><br>|
|RamReadLatencyVerification|Check that the FIFO correctly handles a `RamReadLatency` of 0, ensuring immediate data availability at the pop interface.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench sets the `RamReadLatency` parameter to 0 to verify immediate data synchronization at the pop interface.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `rst` to reset the FIFO and then deasserts it to begin normal operation. The testbench monitors the reset process to ensure the FIFO is correctly initialized.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_valid` and provides data on `push_data` with a width defined by `Width`. The testbench monitors `push_ready` and waits for the design to assert it, indicating the FIFO is ready to accept data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` to indicate readiness to receive data. The testbench monitors `pop_valid` and waits for the design to assert it eventually, given the `RamReadLatency` is 0, ensuring immediate data availability.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench reads data from `pop_data` and verifies it matches the data provided on `push_data`, confirming correct latency handling. If `pop_valid` is not asserted eventually, the testbench logs an error, marks the test as failed, and suggests further debugging and design re-evaluation.  <br><br>|
