|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|BasicPushPopFunctionality|Check that the FIFO correctly handles data push and pop operations while adhering to the ready-valid handshake protocol, updating status flags accurately, and respecting bypass mode.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `rst` high to reset the FIFO and related components, ensuring a known initial state. It then deasserts `rst` after a few clock cycles. The testbench initializes `push_valid`, `push_data`, `pop_ready`, and `finished` to `0`, and `error_count` to `0`. It monitors `full` and `empty`, expecting `full` to be `0` and `empty` to be `1`.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_valid` high and provides a sequence of data on `push_data`. It monitors `push_ready`, waiting for the design to drive it high, indicating that the FIFO can accept data. The testbench continues this process until the design eventually drives `full` high, indicating the FIFO is full.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench deasserts `push_valid` and asserts `pop_ready` high to start popping data. It monitors `pop_valid`, waiting for the design to drive it high, indicating valid data is available. The testbench reads data from `pop_data` and continues popping until the design eventually drives `empty` high, indicating the FIFO is empty.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Throughout the test, the testbench ensures that the `valid` signal remains stable when backpressure is applied, as controlled by the `EnableCoverBackpressure` and `EnableAssertValidStability` parameters. It also checks that the `data` signal remains stable under backpressure conditions, as controlled by the `EnableAssertDataStability` parameter.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench verifies that no valid bits are asserted at the end of the test, as ensured by the `EnableAssertFinalNotValid` parameter.  <br><br>|
|BypassModeVerification|Check that the bypass mode allows data to be transferred directly from the push interface to the pop interface with zero-cycle latency when the FIFO is empty and bypass is enabled.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench sets the `EnableBypass` parameter to 1 and drives `push_valid` high with data on `push_data[Width-1:0]`. The testbench monitors the `empty` signal, waiting for the design to drive it high, indicating the FIFO is empty.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` and monitors `pop_valid`, waiting for the design to drive it high, indicating that data is available for popping.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench waits for the design to drive data on `pop_data[PopWidth-1:0]` and verifies that it matches the data driven on `push_data[Width-1:0]`, confirming zero-cycle latency.  <br><br>|
|FullConditionHandling|Check that the FIFO correctly handles full conditions and backpressure, ensuring no additional data is accepted until space is available. Verify the correct assertion of backpressure signals and the transition of the `full` signal.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench drives `push_valid` high and provides data on `push_data` with the correct width as specified by the `Width` parameter until the design eventually drives `full` high, indicating the FIFO is full. The testbench monitors `full` to confirm this condition.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench continues to drive `push_valid` high and monitors `push_ready`, waiting for the design to eventually drive it low, indicating backpressure due to the FIFO being full.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` high to initiate a pop operation and monitors `full`, waiting for the design to drive it low in the next cycle, indicating space is available in the FIFO.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench verifies that `push_ready` is driven high by the design in the next cycle after `full` is driven low, allowing new data to be pushed into the FIFO.  <br><br>|
|PushDataStabilityUnderBackpressure|Check that the `push_data` signal remains stable during backpressure conditions to ensure data integrity when the FIFO cannot accept new data.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_valid` high and drives a constant value on `push_data`. The testbench continues this until it waits for the design to drive `full` high, indicating the FIFO is full.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench monitors `push_ready` and waits for the design to drive it low, indicating backpressure.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench ensures that `push_data` remains unchanged while `push_ready` is low, verifying data stability. This is monitored by the testbench for the entire duration that `push_ready` is low.  <br><br>|
|FinalStateAssertion|Check that the FIFO is empty and no valid bits are asserted at the end of the test, ensuring all data has been processed correctly.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench deasserts `push_valid` immediately after the last push operation is completed, when both `push_valid` and `push_ready` are high, indicating the FIFO has accepted the data. The testbench monitors `push_valid` to ensure it is deasserted immediately after data acceptance.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` and monitors `pop_valid`, ensuring `pop_ready` remains high continuously until `items` count reaches zero, indicating all data has been popped. The testbench waits for the design to drive `pop_valid` high in conjunction with `pop_ready` to confirm data transfer.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench monitors `slots`, waiting for the design to eventually drive it to zero, indicating the FIFO is empty.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench waits for the design to drive `empty` high, confirming the FIFO is empty.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench waits for the design to drive `full` low, confirming the FIFO is not full.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench monitors `items`, waiting for the design to eventually drive it to zero, indicating no items remain in the FIFO.  <br><br>|
