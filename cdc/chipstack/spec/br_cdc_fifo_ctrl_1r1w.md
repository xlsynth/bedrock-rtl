### Input Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|push_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `push_valid` indicates that valid data is available on the `push_data` port for writing into the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules assert `push_valid` to signal that the data on `push_data` is ready to be written into the FIFO. This signal is used in conjunction with `push_ready` to manage data flow into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted (set to 1) and `push_ready` is also asserted, the data on `push_data` is written into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_ready` is not asserted, the data is not written, and `push_valid` should remain asserted until `push_ready` becomes active, indicating the FIFO can accept new data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `push_valid` is 1 and `push_ready` is 0, the data is not written, and the user should keep `push_valid` asserted until `push_ready` becomes 1.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `EnableAssertPushValidStability` is enabled, `push_valid` should remain stable (not toggle) when the FIFO is backpressured (i.e., `push_ready` is not asserted).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_valid` and `push_ready` is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring no data is lost or overwritten in the FIFO.|
|push_data|**Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `push_data` is used to provide the data that needs to be written into the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with `push_data` by driving it with the data they wish to enqueue into the FIFO. This data is considered valid when `push_valid` is asserted.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is high and `push_ready` is also high, the data on `push_data` is captured and written to the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The width of `push_data` is determined by the `Width` parameter, allowing for flexibility in the size of the data being handled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_full` is asserted, indicating the FIFO is full, `push_ready` will be low, and the data on `push_data` will not be accepted, regardless of `push_valid`.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The stability of `push_data` is crucial when backpressure is applied. If `EnableAssertPushDataStability` is set, the design will assert that `push_data` remains stable when `push_ready` is low due to backpressure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_data` and `push_valid` is critical for ensuring data integrity, especially in scenarios where the FIFO is near capacity or when the system is experiencing high throughput demands.|
|pop_ready|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_ready` port indicates the readiness of the consumer side to accept data from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `pop_ready` port by asserting it when they are ready to receive data from the FIFO. This signal is typically driven by the consumer logic that processes the data being popped from the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted (set to 1), it signals that the consumer is ready to accept data. If `pop_valid` is also asserted, data transfer occurs from the FIFO to the consumer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is deasserted (set to 0), it indicates that the consumer cannot accept data at the moment, and the FIFO will not present new data on `pop_data`, even if `pop_valid` is asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `pop_ready` and `pop_valid` follows a ready-valid handshake protocol, ensuring data is only transferred when both signals are high.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_ready` signal can influence the backpressure on the FIFO. If `pop_ready` is consistently low, it can cause the FIFO to fill up, potentially leading to `push_full` being asserted on the push side, which prevents further data from being written into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The timing of `pop_ready` relative to `pop_clk` can affect the latency and throughput of the FIFO, especially when combined with parameters like `RamReadLatency` and `RegisterPopOutputs`.|
|pop_ram_rd_data_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` port indicates the validity of data being read from the RAM during a pop operation.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` signal to determine when the data available on the `pop_ram_rd_data` port is valid and can be safely used.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` is asserted (logic high), it signifies that the data on `pop_ram_rd_data` is valid and ready to be consumed by the receiving logic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` is deasserted (logic low), the data on `pop_ram_rd_data` should not be considered valid, and any logic dependent on this data should wait for the signal to be asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `RamReadLatency` is set to 2, the `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` signal will be asserted two cycles after the `pop_ram_rd_addr_valid` is asserted, indicating the data is ready to be read.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The timing of `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the FIFO controller operates correctly, especially when `RamReadLatency` is greater than zero.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The synchronization between `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` and `pop_ram_rd_data` ensures that the FIFO can handle asynchronous read operations without data corruption, even when there are multiple stages of synchronization (`NumSyncStages`).|
|pop_ram_rd_data|**Type:** `logic[    Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_ram_rd_data` port is used to receive data from the RAM during a read operation on the pop side of the FIFO controller.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `pop_ram_rd_data` port by monitoring it for valid data when `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` is asserted. This port provides the data that has been read from the RAM, which is then processed or forwarded by the receiving module.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` is high, the data present on `pop_ram_rd_data` is valid and can be used by the receiving module.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The width of the data is determined by the `Width` parameter, meaning it can vary based on the configuration of the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data on `pop_ram_rd_data` should be stable and valid for the duration that `pop_ram_rd_data_valid` is asserted.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The timing of when data appears on `pop_ram_rd_data` is influenced by the `RamReadLatency` parameter. A non-zero latency means there will be a delay between when a read address is issued and when the data appears on this port.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data on `pop_ram_rd_data` is part of the asynchronous FIFO operation, which means it is synchronized across different clock domains (`push_clk` and `pop_clk`), potentially introducing additional latency or synchronization stages as defined by `NumSyncStages`.|

### Output Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|push_ready|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_ready` port indicates whether the FIFO is ready to accept new data on the push interface.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_ready` port by checking its status before attempting to send data to the FIFO. If `push_ready` is high, the module can assert `push_valid` and provide data on `push_data`.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_ready` is high, the FIFO can accept new data, and the user can assert `push_valid` along with valid data on `push_data`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_ready` is low, the FIFO cannot accept new data, indicating that it is either full or experiencing backpressure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_ready` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is not ready to accept data until it is properly initialized and any reset conditions are cleared.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_ready` signal is influenced by the FIFO's internal state, such as the fullness indicated by `push_full` and the number of available slots indicated by `push_slots`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `push_ready` can be affected by the `RegisterResetActive` parameter, which may introduce additional latency in the ready signal due to synchronization stages.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_ready` and `pop_ready` can determine the overall throughput and efficiency of the FIFO, especially in scenarios with varying push and pop rates.|
|push_full|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_full` port indicates whether the FIFO is full and cannot accept more data.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules check the `push_full` signal to determine if they can safely assert `push_valid` and send new data via `push_data`. If `push_full` is high, the FIFO is full, and no new data should be pushed.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_full` is high (1), the FIFO is full, and the `push_ready` signal will be low, indicating that no new data can be accepted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_full` is low (0), the FIFO has space available, and the `push_ready` signal will be high, allowing new data to be pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_full` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is initially empty and ready to accept data.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_full` signal is directly influenced by the depth of the FIFO (`Depth` parameter) and the current number of entries (`push_slots`). It becomes high when the number of entries reaches the maximum depth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `push_full` is also indirectly affected by the `pop_ready` and `pop_valid` signals, as these determine when data is removed from the FIFO, potentially freeing up space.|
|push_slots|**Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_slots` port indicates the number of available slots in the FIFO for new data entries.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `push_slots` port to determine how many more data entries can be pushed into the FIFO without causing overflow. This information is crucial for managing data flow and preventing data loss due to overflow.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `push_slots` = Depth, indicating that all slots are available for new data entries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, indicating a successful data push, the value of `push_slots` decreases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, when data is popped from the FIFO (indicated by `pop_valid` and `pop_ready` being high), the value of `push_slots` increases by one, reflecting the newly available space.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `push_slots` ranges from 0 (FIFO is full) to Depth (FIFO is empty).<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_slots` reaches 0, the FIFO is full, and `push_ready` will be deasserted, preventing further data pushes until space becomes available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Monitoring `push_slots` can help in implementing flow control mechanisms, ensuring that data producers do not overwhelm the FIFO capacity.|
|push_ram_wr_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_ram_wr_valid` port indicates when valid data is available to be written to the RAM from the push side of the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `push_ram_wr_valid` signal to determine when the FIFO controller is ready to write data to the RAM. This signal is typically used in conjunction with `push_ram_wr_addr` and `push_ram_wr_data` to perform the write operation.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and the FIFO is not full (`push_full` is low), `push_ram_wr_valid` is asserted, indicating that the data on `push_ram_wr_data` is valid and can be written to the address specified by `push_ram_wr_addr`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_full` is high, `push_ram_wr_valid` will not be asserted, as the FIFO cannot accept more data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_ram_wr_valid` = 0, ensuring no write operations are initiated during reset.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The assertion of `push_ram_wr_valid` is dependent on the FIFO's ability to accept new data, which is influenced by the `push_full` signal and the readiness of the RAM to accept new writes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The timing of `push_ram_wr_valid` can be affected by the `RamWriteLatency` parameter, which defines the delay between asserting `push_valid` and the data being ready to write to RAM.|
|push_ram_wr_addr|**Type:** `logic[AddrWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_ram_wr_addr` port is used to specify the address in the external RAM where the data from the `push_data` port should be written.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_ram_wr_addr` port by monitoring it to determine the specific address in the RAM where the next data write operation will occur. This address is crucial for ensuring that data is written to the correct location in the FIFO's memory structure.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Normal Operation**: During normal operation, when `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, `push_ram_wr_addr` provides the address for the next write operation in the RAM. This address increments as new data is pushed into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `push_ram_wr_addr` is typically set to 0, indicating the starting address for write operations once the system resumes normal operation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Address Range**: The address provided by `push_ram_wr_addr` ranges from 0 to `Depth-1`, as determined by the `AddrWidth` parameter, which is calculated based on the `Depth` of the FIFO.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Backpressure Handling**: If the FIFO is full (`push_full` is high), `push_ready` will be low, preventing further increments of `push_ram_wr_addr` until space becomes available. This ensures that no data is overwritten in the RAM.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Synchronization**: The address generation is synchronized with the `push_clk`, ensuring that address updates occur in lockstep with data pushes, maintaining data integrity across clock domains.|
|push_ram_wr_data|**Type:** `logic[    Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `push_ram_wr_data` is used to transfer data from the push interface to the external RAM for storage.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with `push_ram_wr_data` by providing data to be written into the FIFO. This data is then sent to the external RAM when `push_ram_wr_valid` is asserted.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, the data on `push_data` is captured and transferred to `push_ram_wr_data`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data is written to the address specified by `push_ram_wr_addr` in the external RAM.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_ram_wr_data` = 0, as it is not explicitly assigned a value during reset.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `push_ram_wr_data` is directly influenced by the `Width` parameter, determining the bit-width of the data being transferred.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data transfer occurs only when the FIFO is not full (`push_full` is low) and the push interface is ready to accept new data (`push_ready` is high).|
|pop_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_valid` port indicates when valid data is available to be read from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `pop_valid` signal to determine when they can safely read data from the `pop_data` port. It is typically used in conjunction with the `pop_ready` signal to manage data flow.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_valid` is asserted (logic high), it signifies that the data on `pop_data` is valid and can be read.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `pop_valid` is dependent on the FIFO having data available and the readiness of the pop interface.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is also asserted, the data is consumed, and `pop_valid` may be de-asserted in the next cycle if no more data is available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_valid` = 0, indicating no valid data is available immediately after a reset.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The assertion of `pop_valid` is influenced by the `RamReadLatency` parameter, which determines the delay between asserting `pop_ram_rd_addr_valid` and receiving valid data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter can introduce additional latency, affecting when `pop_valid` is asserted relative to data availability.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `pop_valid` will remain asserted as long as there is valid data in the FIFO and `pop_ready` is not asserted, allowing for backpressure handling.|
|pop_data|**Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_data` serves as the output data port for the FIFO controller, providing the data that is read from the FIFO when a pop operation is performed.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with `pop_data` by monitoring it to receive the data output from the FIFO. This interaction typically occurs when `pop_valid` is asserted, indicating that the data on `pop_data` is valid and ready to be consumed.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_valid` is high and `pop_ready` is asserted, `pop_data` presents the data read from the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data on `pop_data` is valid only when `pop_valid` is high, signaling that the FIFO has data available to be read.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_data` = 0, as it is not assigned a specific value during reset.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `pop_data` is influenced by the `RamReadLatency` parameter, which determines the delay between asserting `pop_ram_rd_addr_valid` and receiving valid data on `pop_data`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `RegisterPopOutputs` is set to 1, `pop_data` may experience an additional cycle of latency, as it will be registered before being output, potentially improving timing at the cost of increased latency.|
|pop_empty|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_empty` port indicates whether the FIFO is empty, meaning there are no items available to be read from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `pop_empty` signal to determine if there are items available for reading. If `pop_empty` is high (1), it indicates that the FIFO is empty and no data can be read. Conversely, if it is low (0), data is available for reading.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_empty` = 1, indicating the FIFO is initially empty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_empty` is 1, the FIFO has no items, and `pop_valid` will not assert, meaning no valid data is available for reading.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_empty` transitions to 0, it indicates that there are items in the FIFO, and `pop_valid` may assert if `pop_ready` is also asserted, allowing data to be read.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_empty` signal will return to 1 when all items have been read from the FIFO, and no new items have been pushed.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_empty` signal is directly influenced by the `push_valid` and `pop_ready` interactions. If `push_valid` is consistently high and `pop_ready` is low, the FIFO may fill up, causing `pop_empty` to remain low until items are read.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_empty` is also dependent on the parameters `Depth`, `RamReadLatency`, and `RegisterPopOutputs`, which can affect the timing and latency of when the FIFO transitions between empty and non-empty states.|

### Design Parameters
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Depth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `Depth` parameter defines the number of entries in the FIFO, determining its storage capacity. It influences how many data items can be stored in the FIFO at any given time. Users interact with the design by pushing data into the FIFO when `push_valid` is asserted and retrieving data when `pop_ready` is asserted. The `Depth` parameter impacts the behavior of signals like `push_full`, which indicates when the FIFO cannot accept more data, and `pop_empty`, which signals when there are no items to pop. A larger `Depth` allows for more data to be buffered, accommodating scenarios with varying data production and consumption rates.|
|Width|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `Width` parameter defines the bit-width of each data entry within the FIFO. It determines how many bits are used to represent each piece of data that is pushed into or popped from the FIFO. Users interact with this parameter by setting it according to the size of the data they need to handle. For example, if a user needs to store 16-bit data entries, they would configure the `Width` parameter to accommodate that size. This parameter directly impacts the `push_data`, `pop_data`, `push_ram_wr_data`, and `pop_ram_rd_data` signals, as these signals will have a width equal to the value of the `Width` parameter. Adjusting this parameter allows the FIFO to be tailored to different data sizes, ensuring compatibility with various data processing requirements.|
|RegisterPopOutputs|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter is used to control the behavior of the pop interface in the FIFO controller. When set, it ensures that the `pop_valid` and `pop_data` signals are always sourced directly from a register. This configuration can improve the timing of paths that depend on the pop interface by providing more stable and predictable outputs. However, it introduces an additional cycle of latency for the pop operation, as the data must pass through an extra register stage. This trade-off is beneficial in scenarios where timing closure is challenging, and the stability of the pop interface is prioritized over minimal latency.|
|RegisterResetActive|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RegisterResetActive` parameter is used to control the registration of reset signals within the FIFO controller. When enabled, it ensures that the `push_rst` and `pop_rst` signals are registered on their respective clock domains (`push_clk` and `pop_clk`) before being sent to the clock domain crossing (CDC) synchronizers. This registration adds an additional cycle to both the cut-through latency and the backpressure latency, which can impact the timing and performance of the FIFO. By default, this parameter is set to ensure stability and proper synchronization of reset signals across different clock domains, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing metastability issues. Users can adjust this parameter based on their specific design requirements and the nature of their reset signal sources.|
|RamWriteLatency|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RamWriteLatency` parameter defines the number of push cycles required after `push_ram_wr_valid` is asserted before it is safe to read the newly written data. This parameter is crucial for ensuring data integrity when interacting with external RAM. Users must configure this parameter based on the latency characteristics of the RAM being used. For example, if the RAM requires a certain number of cycles to complete a write operation, `RamWriteLatency` should be set accordingly to prevent premature reads. This ensures that `push_data` is correctly written and available for subsequent operations, maintaining the reliability of the FIFO's data handling.|
|RamReadLatency|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RamReadLatency` parameter defines the number of cycles between asserting `pop_ram_rd_addr_valid` and receiving valid data on `pop_ram_rd_data`. It allows users to configure the FIFO controller to accommodate RAMs with varying read latencies. For example, if the RAM requires multiple cycles to output data after receiving a read address, `RamReadLatency` should be set accordingly to ensure `pop_data` is valid when `pop_valid` is asserted. This parameter is crucial for synchronizing the FIFO's pop interface with the RAM's read timing, ensuring data integrity and proper operation across different memory configurations.|
|NumSyncStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `NumSyncStages` parameter determines the number of synchronization stages used for the gray code counters within the FIFO controller. This parameter is crucial for ensuring reliable data transfer between asynchronous clock domains, specifically between `push_clk` and `pop_clk`. By adjusting the number of synchronization stages, users can control the robustness of the synchronization process, which is particularly important in scenarios where clock domains have significant frequency differences or when minimizing metastability risks is a priority. The parameter allows users to tailor the design to meet specific timing and reliability requirements, enhancing the overall stability of the FIFO operation in asynchronous environments.|
|EnableCoverPushBackpressure|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableCoverPushBackpressure` parameter is used to configure the FIFO controller's behavior regarding backpressure on the push side. When enabled, it allows the design to cover scenarios where the push interface experiences backpressure, meaning the `push_ready` signal may be de-asserted, indicating that the FIFO cannot accept new data. This parameter is particularly useful for testing and verification purposes, as it ensures that the design can handle situations where the FIFO is full (`push_full` is asserted) and cannot accommodate additional `push_data`. By enabling this parameter, users can verify that the FIFO controller correctly manages backpressure conditions, ensuring that `push_valid` data is not lost or overwritten when the FIFO is unable to accept new entries.|
|EnableAssertPushValidStability|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableAssertPushValidStability` parameter is designed to ensure the stability of the `push_valid` signal during backpressure conditions. When enabled, it asserts that the `push_valid` signal remains stable and does not fluctuate when the FIFO is experiencing backpressure, meaning when `push_ready` is not asserted. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring that the data being pushed into the FIFO is consistent and reliable. For example, if a user sets this parameter, they can expect that once `push_valid` is asserted, it will remain asserted until the FIFO is ready to accept new data, preventing any potential data corruption or loss due to signal instability.|
|EnableAssertPushDataStability|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableAssertPushDataStability` parameter is used to control the stability of the `push_data` signal when the FIFO experiences backpressure. When enabled, it ensures that `push_data` remains stable and unchanged during cycles where `push_ready` is not asserted, preventing data corruption or unintended overwrites. This is particularly important in scenarios where the FIFO is full (`push_full` is asserted) and cannot accept new data, ensuring that the data integrity is maintained until it can be safely written to the FIFO. Users can configure this parameter to enforce data stability checks, which can be crucial for applications requiring strict data consistency during backpressure conditions.|
|EnableAssertFinalNotValid|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableAssertFinalNotValid` parameter is used to enforce a specific condition at the end of a test scenario. When enabled, it asserts that no valid signals are active and that the FIFO is empty, ensuring that the FIFO has been completely drained. This parameter is crucial for verifying that the FIFO operates correctly under test conditions, confirming that all data has been processed and no residual data remains. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to ensure the design meets expected behavior, particularly in scenarios where the FIFO must be empty at the conclusion of operations.|
|AddrWidth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>`AddrWidth` determines the bit-width required to address the entries in the FIFO. It is calculated based on the `Depth` of the FIFO, ensuring that all possible addresses within the FIFO can be uniquely represented. This parameter is crucial for defining the size of the address bus used in the FIFO's RAM interface, specifically for signals like `push_ram_wr_addr` and `pop_ram_rd_addr`. By setting `AddrWidth`, users ensure that the FIFO can handle the specified number of entries, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval operations.|
|CountWidth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>`CountWidth` determines the bit-width required to represent the count of entries in the FIFO, including the empty state. It is calculated based on the `Depth` of the FIFO, ensuring that the design can accurately track the number of items stored. This parameter is crucial for managing the FIFO's status flags, such as `push_slots` and `pop_items`, which indicate available space and occupied entries, respectively. Users interact with the design by observing these status flags to determine when it is safe to push new data or pop existing data. For example, when `push_slots` indicates available space, users can assert `push_valid` with new `push_data`. Conversely, when `pop_items` shows available entries, users can assert `pop_ready` to retrieve `pop_data`. The `CountWidth` ensures these operations are accurately managed, preventing overflow or underflow conditions.|
