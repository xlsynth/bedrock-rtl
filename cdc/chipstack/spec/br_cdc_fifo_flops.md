### Input Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|push_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_valid` port indicates when valid data is available to be written into the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules assert `push_valid` to signal that the data present on `push_data` is valid and ready to be pushed into the FIFO. This signal is typically driven by the logic that produces data for the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted (set to 1) and `push_ready` is also asserted, the data on `push_data` is successfully written into the FIFO on the rising edge of `push_clk`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_valid` is deasserted (set to 0), no data is written into the FIFO, regardless of the state of `push_ready`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_valid` is asserted but `push_ready` is deasserted, the FIFO is not ready to accept new data, and the data on `push_data` should be held stable until `push_ready` is asserted again.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The stability of `push_valid` during backpressure conditions is controlled by the parameter `EnableAssertPushValidStability`. If this parameter is set, `push_valid` must remain stable when `push_ready` is deasserted, ensuring data integrity during backpressure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_valid` and `push_ready` follows a ready-valid handshake protocol, which is crucial for synchronizing data transfer between different clock domains in the FIFO.|
|push_data|**Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_data` port is used to input data into the FIFO for storage and eventual retrieval.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_data` port by providing data that is intended to be stored in the FIFO. This data is presented alongside a `push_valid` signal to indicate that the data is ready to be written into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted (set to 1) and `push_ready` is also asserted, the data on `push_data` is successfully written into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The width of the data is determined by the `Width` parameter, meaning `push_data` can hold values ranging from 0 to \(2^{\text{Width}} - 1\).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_ready` is not asserted, the data on `push_data` is not written into the FIFO, even if `push_valid` is asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data should remain stable when `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is not, to ensure data integrity when backpressure is applied.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The stability of `push_data` during backpressure conditions can be controlled by the `EnableAssertPushDataStability` parameter. If set, it ensures that `push_data` remains stable when `push_valid` is asserted but `push_ready` is not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_data` and `push_valid` is crucial for maintaining data integrity, especially in scenarios where the FIFO is full (`push_full` is asserted) and cannot accept new data.|
|pop_ready|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_ready` port indicates the readiness of the receiving side to accept data from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules set the `pop_ready` signal to high (1) when they are ready to receive data from the FIFO. This signal is typically driven by the consumer logic that processes the data being popped from the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is high (1) and `pop_valid` is also high (1), data is successfully transferred from the FIFO to the consumer, and the FIFO advances to the next data item.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is low (0), the FIFO will not transfer data, even if `pop_valid` is high (1), effectively stalling the pop operation until `pop_ready` becomes high (1) again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The combination of `pop_ready` and `pop_valid` being high (1) on the same cycle ensures that data is transferred, maintaining the ready-valid handshake protocol.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_ready` signal can be used to apply backpressure to the FIFO. If the consumer is not ready to accept data, setting `pop_ready` to low (0) will prevent data from being popped, potentially causing the FIFO to fill up and `push_ready` to go low (0) if the FIFO becomes full.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_ready` directly influences the `pop_empty` signal. If `pop_ready` is consistently low (0), the FIFO may remain non-empty, as data is not being consumed.|

### Output Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|push_ready|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_ready` port indicates whether the FIFO is ready to accept new data on the push side.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_ready` port by checking its value before attempting to send data to the FIFO. If `push_ready` is high, the module can assert `push_valid` and provide data on `push_data`.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_ready` is high (1), the FIFO can accept new data. The user can assert `push_valid` and provide data on `push_data`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_ready` is low (0), the FIFO cannot accept new data, and the user should not assert `push_valid`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `push_ready` is influenced by the FIFO's current state, such as whether it is full or experiencing backpressure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_ready` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is not ready to accept data until it is properly initialized and synchronized.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_ready` signal is crucial for managing flow control and preventing data loss. It ensures that data is only pushed into the FIFO when there is space available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `push_ready` can be affected by parameters like `Depth`, `RegisterResetActive`, and `EnableCoverPushBackpressure`, which influence the FIFO's capacity and synchronization characteristics.|
|pop_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_valid` indicates when valid data is available on the `pop_data` port for the consumer to read.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor `pop_valid` to determine when they can safely read data from `pop_data`. When `pop_valid` is asserted (logic high), it signals that the data on `pop_data` is valid and ready to be consumed.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_valid` = 0.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and there is valid data in the FIFO, `pop_valid` will be asserted, indicating that the data on `pop_data` is valid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is deasserted, `pop_valid` may remain asserted if there is still valid data available, but no new data will be presented until `pop_ready` is asserted again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `pop_valid` will be deasserted when the FIFO is empty (`pop_empty` is asserted), indicating no valid data is available for reading.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The assertion of `pop_valid` is dependent on the internal state of the FIFO and the synchronization between `push_clk` and `pop_clk`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The parameter `RegisterPopOutputs` can affect the latency of `pop_valid` assertion, potentially adding an additional cycle of latency if set to 1, which may be useful for timing optimization.|
|pop_data|**Type:** `logic[     Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_data` is used to output the data from the FIFO when a read operation is performed.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with `pop_data` by reading the data that is available when `pop_valid` is asserted. This indicates that valid data is present on the `pop_data` port and can be consumed by the receiving logic.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_valid` is high and `pop_ready` is asserted, `pop_data` presents the next available data word from the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data width of `pop_data` is determined by the `Width` parameter, meaning it can hold a data word of `Width` bits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_data` is not explicitly assigned a value, so it defaults to 0 or an undefined state depending on the synthesis tool and target technology.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `RegisterPopOutputs` is set to 1, `pop_data` may experience an additional cycle of latency due to the data being registered before being output, which can improve timing at the cost of increased latency.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_data` is directly influenced by the FIFO's internal state, such as whether the FIFO is empty (`pop_empty` is high) or full (`push_full` is high), affecting when data can be read or written.|
|push_full|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_full` port indicates whether the FIFO is full and cannot accept more data.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `push_full` signal to determine if they can continue sending data to the FIFO. If `push_full` is asserted, the user must wait before attempting to push more data.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_full` is high (1), the FIFO is full, and no additional data can be pushed into it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_full` is low (0), there is space available in the FIFO, and data can be pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_full` = 0, indicating the FIFO is empty and ready to accept data.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_full` signal is directly influenced by the number of items in the FIFO (`push_slots`) and the `Depth` parameter. When the number of items equals `Depth`, `push_full` is asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `push_full` can be affected by the `push_clk` and `push_rst` signals, as these control the timing and reset conditions of the FIFO.|
|push_slots|**Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_slots` port indicates the number of available slots in the FIFO for new data entries.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `push_slots` port to determine how many more data entries can be pushed into the FIFO without causing overflow. This information is crucial for managing data flow and preventing data loss due to overflow.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `push_slots` = `Depth`, indicating that all slots are available for new data entries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high, a data entry is successfully pushed into the FIFO, and `push_slots` decreases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, when `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high, a data entry is removed from the FIFO, and `push_slots` increases by one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_slots` reaches zero, it indicates that the FIFO is full, and no more data can be pushed until some data is popped.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `push_slots` can be used to dynamically adjust the rate of data pushing to prevent overflow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- In scenarios where `push_slots` is consistently low, it may indicate a bottleneck in the data flow, prompting a need to adjust the data consumption rate on the pop side.|
|pop_empty|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_empty` port indicates whether the FIFO is empty, meaning there are no items available to be read from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `pop_empty` signal to determine if there are items available for reading. If `pop_empty` is high, it indicates that the FIFO is empty, and no data can be popped.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_empty` is high (1), it signifies that the FIFO contains no items, and the `pop_data` output is not valid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_empty` is low (0), it indicates that there are items in the FIFO available for reading, and `pop_data` can be valid if `pop_valid` is also high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_empty` = 1, indicating the FIFO starts in an empty state.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_empty` signal transitions from high to low when the first item is pushed into the FIFO and becomes available for popping.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, `pop_empty` transitions from low to high when the last item is popped from the FIFO, leaving it empty.|
|pop_items|**Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_items` port indicates the number of valid data entries currently available in the FIFO for reading.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `pop_items` port to determine how many data entries are ready to be popped from the FIFO. This information can be used to manage data flow and ensure that the consumer side does not attempt to read from an empty FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `pop_items` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is empty and no data is available for popping.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- As data is pushed into the FIFO (when `push_valid` is asserted and `push_ready` is high), the `pop_items` count increases, reflecting the number of entries available for popping.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When data is popped from the FIFO (when `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high), the `pop_items` count decreases accordingly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `pop_items` ranges from 0 to `Depth`, where `Depth` is the maximum number of entries the FIFO can hold.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_items` count provides a real-time view of the FIFO's occupancy, which can be crucial for managing flow control in systems with varying data rates.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_items` equals `Depth`, it indicates that the FIFO is full, and no additional data can be pushed until some data is popped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, if `pop_items` is 0, it indicates that the FIFO is empty, and no data can be popped until new data is pushed into the FIFO.|

### Design Parameters
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Depth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `Depth` parameter defines the number of entries in the FIFO, determining its storage capacity. It directly influences how many data items can be held in the FIFO at any given time. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to accommodate the maximum expected data burst size between the push and pop interfaces. For example, if the FIFO needs to handle a burst of data without overflow, `Depth` should be configured to be large enough to store all incoming data until it can be processed. The parameter must be set to at least 2 to ensure proper FIFO operation, allowing for at least one item to be stored while another is being processed.|
|Width|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `Width` parameter defines the bit-width of each data entry within the FIFO. It determines how many bits are used to represent each piece of data that is pushed into or popped from the FIFO. Users interact with the design by providing data of this specified width through the `push_data` signal when `push_valid` is asserted. The design ensures that the data width remains consistent across the FIFO operations, affecting how data is stored and retrieved. For example, if `Width` is set to a higher value, each data entry can hold more information, which may be necessary for applications requiring larger data units. The parameter must be set to at least 1, ensuring that there is a minimum bit-width for data handling.|
|RegisterPopOutputs|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter is used to control the timing of the `pop_valid` and `pop_data` signals in the FIFO design. When set, it ensures that these signals are always sourced from a register, which can improve timing performance for paths dependent on the pop interface. This comes at the cost of an additional cycle of latency when data is popped from the FIFO. Users can adjust this parameter based on their timing requirements and latency tolerance. For example, enabling this parameter might be beneficial in scenarios where the pop interface is on a critical timing path and requires stable, registered outputs.|
|RegisterResetActive|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RegisterResetActive` parameter determines whether the reset signals `push_rst` and `pop_rst` are registered on their respective clocks (`push_clk` and `pop_clk`) before being sent to the CDC synchronizers. This affects the latency characteristics of the FIFO. When enabled, it adds an additional cycle to both the cut-through latency and the backpressure latency. This parameter is crucial for ensuring that reset signals are properly synchronized across clock domains, which can be important for maintaining data integrity and preventing metastability in asynchronous FIFO designs. Users should enable this parameter if the reset signals are not directly driven by registers, ensuring reliable operation during reset conditions.|
|NumSyncStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `NumSyncStages` parameter determines the number of synchronization stages used for the gray code counters within the FIFO design. This parameter is crucial for ensuring reliable data transfer between asynchronous clock domains, specifically between `push_clk` and `pop_clk`. By configuring the number of synchronization stages, users can adjust the robustness of the FIFO against metastability issues that may arise due to clock domain crossings. A higher number of synchronization stages generally increases the reliability of the data transfer but may also introduce additional latency. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to a value that balances the need for data integrity with acceptable latency, depending on the specific requirements of their application.|
|FlopRamDepthTiles|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `FlopRamDepthTiles` parameter is used to configure the number of tiles in the depth (address) dimension of the FIFO's internal flop-RAM. This parameter must be at least 1 and should evenly divide the `Depth` of the FIFO. It allows users to partition the depth of the FIFO into smaller segments, which can be beneficial for optimizing memory utilization and managing data storage efficiently. By adjusting this parameter, users can influence how the FIFO's memory is organized, potentially impacting the timing and performance characteristics of the FIFO's read and write operations.|
|FlopRamWidthTiles|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `FlopRamWidthTiles` parameter is used to configure the internal memory structure of the FIFO design. It determines how the width of the data entries is divided into smaller segments or tiles. This segmentation allows for more efficient memory utilization and can optimize the design for specific hardware implementations. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to a value that evenly divides the `Width` of the FIFO, ensuring that the internal memory can be organized into an optimal number of tiles. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the data width is large, and dividing it into smaller tiles can help in managing memory resources more effectively. For example, if the `Width` is set to a value that is a multiple of `FlopRamWidthTiles`, the design can efficiently handle data operations by processing each tile independently, potentially improving performance and reducing latency.|
|FlopRamAddressDepthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>`FlopRamAddressDepthStages` is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages along the write and read address paths within the FIFO's depth dimension. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the FIFO by inserting additional stages, which can help meet specific timing requirements or improve data stability during address transitions. By increasing the number of stages, users can potentially reduce setup and hold time violations, especially in high-frequency designs. However, this may also introduce additional latency in the data path. Users should balance the need for timing closure with the impact on latency when configuring this parameter.|
|FlopRamReadDataDepthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `FlopRamReadDataDepthStages` parameter determines the number of pipeline register stages inserted along the read data path in the depth dimension of the FIFO. This parameter is crucial for users who need to manage the timing and latency of data retrieval from the FIFO. By adjusting this parameter, users can control the delay introduced in the read data path, which can be beneficial for meeting specific timing requirements or improving data stability during asynchronous operations. For example, increasing the number of stages can help in scenarios where the read data path needs to be synchronized with slower clock domains or when additional buffering is required to handle variations in data arrival times.|
|FlopRamReadDataWidthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `FlopRamReadDataWidthStages` parameter is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages along the read data path in the width dimension of the FIFO. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing and performance characteristics of the FIFO by adding latency to the read data path. By increasing the number of stages, users can improve the timing closure for designs with critical paths in the read data width dimension. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the FIFO needs to interface with slower or more complex downstream logic, ensuring that data is stable and valid when it reaches the output.|
|EnableCoverPushBackpressure|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableCoverPushBackpressure` parameter is used to configure the behavior of the FIFO design regarding backpressure conditions on the push side. When enabled, it allows the design to cover scenarios where the push side experiences backpressure, meaning the FIFO cannot accept new data because it is full or otherwise unable to process incoming data. This parameter is crucial for testing and verification purposes, ensuring that the design can handle situations where data flow is temporarily halted due to capacity constraints. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to enable or disable the coverage of backpressure scenarios, which helps in validating the robustness of the FIFO under different operating conditions.|
|EnableAssertPushValidStability|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableAssertPushValidStability` parameter is used to control the stability of the `push_valid` signal during backpressure conditions. When enabled, it ensures that `push_valid` remains stable and does not change state while the FIFO is experiencing backpressure, meaning when `push_ready` is not asserted. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing data loss or corruption in scenarios where the FIFO cannot accept new data. Users can configure this parameter to enforce strict stability checks on `push_valid`, ensuring that once data is ready to be pushed, it remains valid until it is successfully accepted by the FIFO. This parameter is particularly useful in designs where data consistency and reliability are critical, and it helps in identifying and debugging issues related to data flow under backpressure conditions.|
|EnableAssertPushDataStability|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableAssertPushDataStability` parameter is used to control the stability of the `push_data` signal during backpressure conditions. When enabled, it ensures that `push_data` remains stable and unchanged when the FIFO is experiencing backpressure, meaning `push_ready` is not asserted. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity when the FIFO cannot accept new data. Users interact with this parameter by configuring it to assert data stability, which is particularly important in scenarios where data consistency is critical. For example, in a system where data must not change until it is successfully written into the FIFO, enabling this parameter would prevent any unintended data modifications during backpressure.|
|EnableAssertFinalNotValid|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableAssertFinalNotValid` parameter is used to ensure the FIFO's state at the end of a test. When enabled, it asserts that no valid bits are set and confirms the FIFO is empty, ensuring data integrity and proper operation. This parameter is crucial for verifying that the FIFO has been completely emptied and no residual data remains, which is essential for applications requiring strict data handling and validation. Users interact with this parameter by configuring it to enforce these checks, thereby enhancing the reliability of the FIFO's operation in scenarios where data consistency is critical.|
|AddrWidth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `AddrWidth` parameter determines the bit-width required to address the entries within the FIFO, based on the configured `Depth`. It is calculated as the logarithm base 2 of the `Depth`, ensuring that all possible addresses within the FIFO can be uniquely represented. This parameter is crucial for defining the size of address-related signals, such as those used for writing and reading data within the FIFO. Users interact with this parameter indirectly by setting the `Depth` of the FIFO, which in turn influences the `AddrWidth`. For example, if the FIFO is configured to hold a certain number of entries, `AddrWidth` ensures that there are enough bits to address each entry uniquely.|
|CountWidth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>`CountWidth` determines the bit-width required to represent the count of items in the FIFO, ranging from 0 to the maximum number of entries (`Depth`). It is crucial for tracking the number of valid data entries currently stored in the FIFO. Users interact with this parameter indirectly through the `push_slots` and `pop_items` signals, which provide real-time status of available slots for new data and the number of items ready to be popped, respectively. This parameter ensures that the FIFO can accurately manage and report its capacity, preventing overflow and underflow conditions.|

### End-to-End Functionality
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Data Transfer with Backpressure Management|The design facilitates the transfer of data between different clock domains using a ready-valid handshake protocol, while effectively managing backpressure. When `push_ready` is asserted, the testbench can push data into the FIFO by asserting `push_valid` and providing data on `push_data`. The design updates `push_slots` to show available slots and asserts `push_full` if the FIFO is full. Concurrently, the testbench asserts `pop_ready` to indicate readiness to receive data. The design checks `pop_empty` to see if the FIFO is empty; if not, it asserts `pop_valid` and provides data on `pop_data`. The testbench reads from `pop_data` when `pop_valid` is asserted. The design updates `pop_items` to reflect the number of items in the FIFO and updates `pop_empty` post-pop operation. It ensures `push_data` and `push_valid` remain stable during backpressure, preventing data corruption. The FIFO maintains data integrity and control signal consistency, even under backpressure conditions.|
|FIFO Status Monitoring|The design continuously monitors and updates FIFO status signals to manage data flow effectively. It updates `push_full` to indicate when the FIFO is full and cannot accept more data, and `pop_empty` to indicate when the FIFO is empty and no data can be popped. The testbench uses `push_slots` to determine the number of additional data entries that can be pushed into the FIFO. Similarly, `pop_items` is used to verify the number of items present in the FIFO. These status signals enable the testbench to manage data flow efficiently, ensuring data is pushed only when space is available and popped only when data is present.|
