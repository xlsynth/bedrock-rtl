### Input Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|push_credit_stall|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_credit_stall` port is used to control the flow of data into the FIFO by indicating when the push operation should be stalled.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_credit_stall` port by driving it with a logic level. When the signal is asserted (logic high), it indicates that the push operation should be temporarily halted, preventing new data from being pushed into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_credit_stall` is asserted (logic high), the FIFO will not accept new data even if `push_valid` is asserted. This allows the system to manage backpressure and prevent overflow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_credit_stall` is deasserted (logic low), the FIFO can accept new data if `push_valid` is also asserted, provided there is available space in the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `push_credit_stall` is high and `push_valid` is high, the data on `push_data` will not be written into the FIFO until `push_credit_stall` is low.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_credit_stall` port can be used in conjunction with the `push_full` signal to manage flow control. If `push_full` is high, indicating the FIFO is full, `push_credit_stall` can be asserted to prevent further data from being pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_credit_stall` and `push_valid` can be used to implement complex flow control mechanisms, ensuring that data is only pushed when the system is ready to handle it.|
|push_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_valid` port indicates when valid data is being presented on the `push_data` port for writing into the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules assert `push_valid` to signal that the data on `push_data` is ready to be pushed into the FIFO. This signal is typically driven by the logic that manages data flow into the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted (logic high), it indicates that the data on `push_data` is valid and should be written into the FIFO, provided that the FIFO is not full (`push_full` is not asserted).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_credit_stall` is asserted, the push operation may be stalled, even if `push_valid` is high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is deasserted (logic low), it indicates that there is no valid data to be written into the FIFO at that clock cycle.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_valid` is asserted while `push_full` is also asserted, the FIFO cannot accept new data, and the data on `push_data` will not be written until `push_full` is deasserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `push_valid` and `push_credit_stall` can affect the timing and flow of data into the FIFO, potentially introducing latency if the credit system stalls the push operation.|
|push_data|**Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_data` port is used to input data into the FIFO for storage and eventual retrieval.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_data` port by driving it with data values they wish to store in the FIFO. The data width is determined by the `Width` parameter, allowing for flexibility in the size of the data being pushed.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted, the data present on `push_data` is considered valid and is pushed into the FIFO if there is available space.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data width is defined by the `Width` parameter, meaning if `Width` is set to 8, `push_data` should be driven with 8-bit values.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `push_credit_stall` is asserted, the data push operation may be stalled, preventing new data from being accepted until the stall condition is cleared.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data on `push_data` is only captured when `push_valid` is high and the FIFO is not full (`push_full` is low), ensuring that only valid and intended data is stored.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction with `push_credit_stall` can introduce latency in data pushing, as it may delay the acceptance of new data into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_data` port works in conjunction with the credit system, where the number of available credits (`credit_available_push`) can influence when new data can be pushed, ensuring that the FIFO does not overflow.|
|pop_ready|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_ready` port indicates the readiness of the receiving side to accept data from the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `pop_ready` port by asserting it when they are ready to receive data from the FIFO. This signal is typically driven by the consumer logic that processes the data being popped from the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted (logic high), it signals that the consumer is ready to accept data. If there is valid data available in the FIFO (`pop_valid` is high), the data (`pop_data`) will be transferred to the consumer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is deasserted (logic low), the FIFO will not transfer data to the consumer, even if data is available. This can be used to apply backpressure to the FIFO, preventing it from popping data until the consumer is ready.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if `pop_ready` is high and `pop_valid` is also high, data transfer occurs. If `pop_ready` is low, no data transfer occurs regardless of the state of `pop_valid`.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The interaction between `pop_ready` and `pop_valid` forms a handshake mechanism. This ensures that data is only transferred when both the producer (FIFO) and consumer are ready, allowing for efficient data flow and preventing data loss.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_ready` signal can be used to manage flow control and prevent overflow in downstream logic by controlling when data is accepted from the FIFO.|
|credit_initial_push|**Type:** `logic[CreditWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `credit_initial_push` port is used to set the initial credit count for the push-side interface of the FIFO. It determines how many data entries can be initially pushed into the FIFO without encountering a stall.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `credit_initial_push` port by assigning it a value that represents the initial number of credits available for pushing data into the FIFO. This value is typically set during the initialization phase of the system.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When the system is initialized, the value assigned to `credit_initial_push` sets the starting credit count for the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `credit_initial_push` is set to a value equal to `Depth`, it allows the FIFO to be filled to its maximum capacity without stalling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `credit_initial_push` is set to a lower value, the FIFO will reach a stall condition sooner, as the available credits will be exhausted more quickly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `credit_initial_push` should be less than or equal to `MaxCredit` to ensure proper operation.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Setting `credit_initial_push` to zero effectively prevents any data from being pushed into the FIFO until additional credits are granted, which can be useful for flow control in certain scenarios.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The initial credit value can be dynamically adjusted based on system requirements, allowing for flexible control over the FIFO's push-side behavior.|
|credit_withhold_push|**Type:** `logic[CreditWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `credit_withhold_push` port is used to specify the number of credits to withhold from the available push credits in the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `credit_withhold_push` port by setting its value to control the number of credits that should be temporarily withheld from the push interface. This is done by assigning a value to the port, which is of type `logic[CreditWidth-1:0]`.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `credit_withhold_push` is set to a non-zero value, the specified number of credits are withheld from the total available credits for pushing data into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- For example, if the FIFO has 10 available credits and `credit_withhold_push` is set to 3, only 7 credits will be available for new push operations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `credit_withhold_push` is set to 0, no credits are withheld, and the full amount of available credits can be used for push operations.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Adjusting `credit_withhold_push` dynamically can be used to manage flow control and prevent overfilling the FIFO, especially in scenarios where downstream modules may not be ready to handle incoming data at full capacity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `credit_withhold_push` can be changed on-the-fly, allowing for flexible and adaptive credit management based on real-time system conditions.|

### Output Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|push_receiver_in_reset|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_receiver_in_reset` port indicates whether the push-side receiver is in a reset state.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `push_receiver_in_reset` signal to determine if the push-side receiver is currently undergoing a reset. This can be useful for coordinating operations that depend on the receiver being active and ready to process data.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When the push-side receiver is in a reset state, `push_receiver_in_reset` is asserted (logic high).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When the receiver is not in reset, `push_receiver_in_reset` is deasserted (logic low).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_receiver_in_reset` = 0, indicating that the receiver is not in reset by default unless explicitly controlled otherwise.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_receiver_in_reset` port does not directly control any operations but serves as an indicator for the reset state of the push-side receiver. This can be crucial for debugging and ensuring proper synchronization in systems where multiple reset domains exist.|
|push_credit|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_credit` port is used to indicate the availability of credit for pushing data into the FIFO. It signals when the FIFO can accept more data entries.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with the `push_credit` port by monitoring its state to determine if they can proceed with sending data to the FIFO. When `push_credit` is asserted, it indicates that there is available space in the FIFO for new data entries.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_credit` is high, it indicates that the FIFO has available credit, allowing the user to push data into the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_credit` is low, it indicates that the FIFO is full or that credit is not available, and the user should stall or wait before attempting to push more data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The state of `push_credit` is influenced by the `push_credit_stall`, `push_valid`, `credit_initial_push`, and `credit_withhold_push` signals, as well as the current state of the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_credit` = 0, indicating that no credit is available until the FIFO is initialized and ready to accept data.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_credit` port can be affected by backpressure from the pop side of the FIFO. If the pop side is not ready to accept data (`pop_ready` is low), it may indirectly influence the availability of credit on the push side.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The credit mechanism allows for flow control, ensuring that data is not lost or overwritten in the FIFO by managing the rate at which data is pushed into the FIFO.|
|pop_valid|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_valid` indicates when valid data is available on the pop interface for reading.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor `pop_valid` to determine when they can safely read data from `pop_data`. It acts as a signal to the receiving side that the data being presented is valid and ready to be consumed.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_valid` is asserted (logic high), it signifies that the data on `pop_data` is valid and can be read by the receiving module.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is also asserted, it indicates that the receiving module is ready to accept the data, allowing for a successful data transfer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_valid` = 0, indicating no valid data is available immediately after a reset.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- `pop_valid` is influenced by the internal state of the FIFO and the `push_valid` signal. If the FIFO is empty (`pop_empty` is high), `pop_valid` will not be asserted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_valid` can be affected by the `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter. If `RegisterPopOutputs` is set to 1, `pop_valid` may have an additional cycle of latency, as the signal is registered before being output.|
|pop_data|**Type:** `logic[Width-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_data` serves as the output data port for the FIFO, providing the data that is read from the FIFO when a pop operation is performed.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules interact with `pop_data` by monitoring it to receive data that has been stored in the FIFO. The data is valid when `pop_valid` is asserted, indicating that the FIFO has data available to be read.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `pop_ready` is asserted and `pop_valid` is high, `pop_data` outputs the next available data from the FIFO.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The data width is determined by the `Width` parameter, meaning `pop_data` can output a vector of size `Width`.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_data` is typically set to 0, as it is not assigned a specific value during reset.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `RegisterPopOutputs` is set to 1, `pop_data` is registered, which may introduce an additional cycle of latency but can improve timing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `pop_data` is directly influenced by the `push_data` input when data is pushed into the FIFO and subsequently popped out, assuming the FIFO is not empty (`pop_empty` is low).|
|push_full|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_full` port indicates whether the FIFO is full and cannot accept more data.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `push_full` signal to determine if they can continue sending data to the FIFO. If `push_full` is asserted, the user should refrain from sending more data until space becomes available.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_full` is `1`, the FIFO is full, and no additional data can be pushed into it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_full` is `0`, there is space available in the FIFO for more data to be pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `push_full` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is initially empty and ready to accept data.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_full` signal is directly influenced by the `push_credit_stall` and `push_valid` signals. If `push_credit_stall` is active and `push_valid` is asserted, the FIFO may quickly transition to a full state.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The depth of the FIFO, determined by the `Depth` parameter, directly affects how quickly `push_full` can be asserted. A smaller `Depth` will result in `push_full` being asserted more frequently under high data input conditions.|
|push_slots|**Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `push_slots` port indicates the number of available slots in the FIFO for new data entries to be pushed.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules can monitor the `push_slots` port to determine how many additional data entries can be pushed into the FIFO without causing an overflow. This information is crucial for managing data flow and preventing data loss due to overfilling the FIFO.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `push_slots` = Depth, indicating that all slots are available for new data entries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and data is successfully pushed into the FIFO, the value of `push_slots` decreases by one for each data entry pushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `pop_ready` is asserted and data is successfully popped from the FIFO, the value of `push_slots` increases by one for each data entry popped, reflecting the newly available space.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `push_slots` will never exceed the `Depth` parameter, as this represents the total number of slots in the FIFO.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_full` is asserted, `push_slots` will be zero, indicating no available slots for new data entries.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `push_slots` port provides a dynamic view of the FIFO's capacity, allowing for real-time adjustments in data flow control based on the current availability of slots.|
|credit_count_push|**Type:** `logic[CreditWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `credit_count_push` port indicates the current count of credits available for push operations in the FIFO.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `credit_count_push` port to determine how many push operations can be performed without exceeding the FIFO's credit limit. This helps in managing flow control and ensuring that the FIFO does not overflow.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `credit_count_push` is initialized to the value of `credit_initial_push`, which sets the starting credit count.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- As push operations occur, the value of `credit_count_push` decreases, reflecting the consumption of credits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When credits are withheld using `credit_withhold_push`, the count is adjusted accordingly, reducing the available credits.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If the FIFO is full (`push_full` is asserted), `credit_count_push` will not decrease further until space becomes available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The port value should never exceed `MaxCredit`, ensuring that the credit count remains within the defined limits.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `credit_count_push` port dynamically adjusts based on the interaction between push operations and credit management, providing real-time feedback on the FIFO's capacity to accept new data.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The credit system allows for flexible flow control, enabling the FIFO to handle varying data rates and backpressure conditions efficiently.|
|credit_available_push|**Type:** `logic[CreditWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `credit_available_push` port indicates the number of available credits for push operations, reflecting how many more data entries can be pushed into the FIFO without exceeding its capacity.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `credit_available_push` port to determine if there is sufficient space in the FIFO to perform a push operation. This helps in managing flow control and preventing overflow.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `credit_available_push` is initialized to `MaxCredit`, indicating that the FIFO is empty and all credits are available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When `push_valid` is asserted and a push operation is successful (i.e., `push_credit` is asserted and `push_credit_stall` is not active), the value of `credit_available_push` decreases by one, reflecting the consumption of a credit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Conversely, when data is popped from the FIFO and `pop_valid` is asserted, the value of `credit_available_push` increases by one, indicating that a credit has been freed up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The value of `credit_available_push` should never exceed `MaxCredit` or fall below zero, ensuring that the FIFO's capacity constraints are respected.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- If `credit_withhold_push` is asserted, it temporarily reduces the number of available credits, which can be used to manage flow control dynamically.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `credit_available_push` port provides a real-time view of the FIFO's capacity, allowing for adaptive control strategies in systems with varying data rates or bursty traffic patterns.|
|pop_empty|**Type:** `logic`.<br><br> **Purpose**: The `pop_empty` port indicates whether the FIFO is empty, meaning there are no items available to be read.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor the `pop_empty` signal to determine if there are items available in the FIFO for reading. When `pop_empty` is asserted (logic high), it signals that the FIFO is empty and no data can be popped.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When the FIFO is empty, `pop_empty` is asserted (logic high).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- When there is at least one item in the FIFO, `pop_empty` is deasserted (logic low).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Reset Value: Upon reset, `pop_empty` = 1, indicating the FIFO starts in an empty state.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The `pop_empty` signal can be used in conjunction with `pop_valid` and `pop_data` to manage read operations. If `pop_empty` is high, `pop_valid` will not be asserted, and no valid `pop_data` will be available.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The behavior of `pop_empty` is directly influenced by the `push_valid` and `pop_ready` signals, as these control the flow of data into and out of the FIFO.|
|pop_items|**Type:** `logic[CountWidth-1:0]`.<br><br> **Purpose**: `pop_items` indicates the number of valid data entries available in the FIFO for reading.<br><br>**Interaction**: Users or other modules monitor `pop_items` to determine how many data entries can be read from the FIFO. This helps in managing read operations and ensuring that data is available before attempting to read.<br><br>**Expected Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Normal Operation**: As data is pushed into the FIFO and becomes available for reading, `pop_items` increments. Conversely, as data is read from the FIFO, `pop_items` decrements.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Full FIFO**: When the FIFO is full, `pop_items` equals `Depth`, indicating that no more data can be pushed until some data is read.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Empty FIFO**: When the FIFO is empty, `pop_items` is 0, indicating that there are no entries available for reading.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Reset Value**: Upon reset, `pop_items` = 0, indicating that the FIFO is empty and no data is available for reading.<br><br>**Interesting Behavior**:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Backpressure Handling**: If `pop_ready` is not asserted, `pop_items` will not decrement even if `pop_valid` is asserted, as no data is being read. This allows the FIFO to handle backpressure effectively.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Synchronization**: The value of `pop_items` is updated based on the `pop_clk`, ensuring that the read side of the FIFO operates correctly in asynchronous clock domains.|

### Design Parameters
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Depth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `Depth` parameter defines the number of entries in the FIFO, determining its storage capacity. It must be at least 2 to ensure proper FIFO operation. Users interact with the design by configuring this parameter to accommodate the desired amount of data that can be buffered between the push and pop interfaces. The `Depth` directly influences the FIFO's ability to handle varying data rates between the producer and consumer, affecting how much data can be stored when the push rate exceeds the pop rate. Adjusting `Depth` allows users to tailor the FIFO to specific application requirements, balancing between resource usage and buffering needs.|
|Width|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `Width` parameter defines the bit-width of each data entry within the FIFO. It determines how many bits are used to represent each piece of data that is pushed into or popped from the FIFO. Users interact with the design by specifying this parameter to match the data size requirements of their application. For example, if the data being processed is 32 bits wide, the `Width` parameter should be set accordingly to accommodate the entire data word. This ensures that the FIFO can handle the data correctly without truncation or padding. The parameter must be set to at least 1, ensuring that there is a minimum bit-width for data handling.|
|MaxCredit|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `MaxCredit` parameter defines the maximum allowable credit for the internal credit counter of the FIFO. It ensures that the credit counter can accommodate at least the number of entries specified by the `Depth` parameter. This parameter is crucial for managing the flow control between the push and pop interfaces, as it determines the maximum number of data entries that can be pushed into the FIFO without being popped. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to control the credit limit, which directly impacts how the FIFO handles backpressure and flow control. For example, if the FIFO is configured with a `Depth` of 4, the `MaxCredit` must be at least 4 to ensure proper operation. However, users are advised not to override the default value unless necessary for design consistency, such as maintaining a uniform credit counter width across different modules.|
|RegisterPushOutputs|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RegisterPushOutputs` parameter is used to control the timing of the `push_credit` signal in the FIFO design. When set, it introduces a retiming stage that ensures the `push_credit` signal is driven directly from a register. This adjustment can help improve the timing closure by adding an additional cycle of latency in the credit loop. Users can leverage this parameter to optimize the design for scenarios where the timing path from `push_valid` to `push_credit` is critical. For example, in a high-frequency design where signal stability is paramount, enabling this parameter can provide a more robust timing path at the expense of increased latency.|
|RegisterPopOutputs|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RegisterPopOutputs` parameter is used to control the timing of the pop interface signals, specifically `pop_valid` and `pop_data`. When set, it ensures these signals are driven directly from a register, which can improve timing by adding a retiming stage. This comes at the cost of an additional cycle of latency for the pop operation. Users can leverage this parameter to optimize the design for better timing performance in scenarios where the pop interface is critical, such as when interfacing with high-speed components or when precise timing alignment is necessary. For example, enabling this parameter can be beneficial in designs where the pop interface needs to meet stringent setup and hold time requirements.|
|RegisterResetActive|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `RegisterResetActive` parameter is used to control the registration of reset signals within the FIFO design. When enabled, it ensures that the `push_rst` and `pop_rst` signals are registered on their respective clock domains (`push_clk` and `pop_clk`) before being sent to the clock domain crossing (CDC) synchronizers. This adds an additional cycle to both the cut-through latency and the backpressure latency, which can impact the timing of the FIFO operations. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to determine whether the reset signals should be registered, which is crucial for designs where reset signals are not directly driven by registers. For example, enabling this parameter can help in scenarios where the reset signals need to be synchronized across different clock domains to prevent metastability issues.|
|NumSyncStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>`NumSyncStages` is used to define the number of synchronization stages for gray code counters within the FIFO design. This parameter is crucial for ensuring reliable data transfer across clock domains by mitigating metastability issues. Users interact with this parameter by setting it to control the robustness of the synchronization process. A higher number of synchronization stages can improve data stability at the cost of increased latency. For example, in a system with significant clock domain crossing challenges, increasing `NumSyncStages` can help ensure that the FIFO operates correctly without data corruption.|
|FlopRamDepthTiles|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `FlopRamDepthTiles` parameter defines the number of segments or partitions along the depth dimension of the internal memory structure within the FIFO. This parameter allows users to configure how the depth of the FIFO is divided, which can impact the memory organization and potentially optimize the design for specific use cases. By adjusting this parameter, users can influence the distribution of memory resources, which may affect the performance characteristics such as access latency and throughput. The parameter must be set to a value that evenly divides the total depth of the FIFO, ensuring a balanced partitioning of the memory.|
|FlopRamWidthTiles|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `FlopRamWidthTiles` parameter is used to configure the internal memory structure of the FIFO in terms of its width dimension. It determines how the width of the data entries is divided into tiles, which can affect how data is stored and accessed within the FIFO. By adjusting this parameter, users can optimize the design for specific data width requirements, ensuring that the width of each entry is evenly divided. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where the data width needs to be partitioned for efficient processing or when aligning with specific architectural constraints.|
|FlopRamAddressDepthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `FlopRamAddressDepthStages` parameter is used to configure the number of pipeline register stages along the write and read address paths within the FIFO's depth dimension. This parameter allows users to adjust the timing characteristics of the FIFO by adding latency to the address paths, which can help meet specific timing requirements or improve the overall performance of the design. By increasing the number of stages, users can potentially enhance the stability and synchronization of address signals, especially in scenarios where the FIFO is operating across different clock domains.|
|FlopRamReadDataDepthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `FlopRamReadDataDepthStages` parameter determines the number of pipeline register stages inserted along the read data path in the depth dimension of the FIFO. This parameter is crucial for users who need to manage the timing and latency of data retrieval from the FIFO. By adjusting this parameter, users can control the delay introduced in the read data path, which can be beneficial for meeting specific timing requirements or improving data stability during asynchronous operations. For example, increasing the number of stages can help in scenarios where the read data needs to be synchronized across different clock domains, ensuring that data is stable and valid when accessed.|
|FlopRamReadDataWidthStages|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>`FlopRamReadDataWidthStages` is a configuration parameter that determines the number of pipeline register stages inserted along the read data path in the width dimension of the FIFO's internal RAM. This parameter is used to adjust the timing characteristics of the data read from the FIFO, potentially improving the timing closure by adding latency to the read data path. Users can configure this parameter to optimize the design for specific timing requirements, ensuring that the data is stable and meets the setup and hold times at the receiving end. For example, increasing the number of stages can help in scenarios where the read data path is critical and requires additional buffering to meet timing constraints.|
|EnableAssertFinalNotValid|**Type:** `bit`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `EnableAssertFinalNotValid` parameter is used to enforce a validation check at the end of a test scenario. When enabled, it ensures that the FIFO is empty and no valid bits are asserted, which helps verify that all data has been correctly processed and no residual data remains. This parameter is particularly useful for debugging and ensuring data integrity in test environments. Users can interact with this parameter by setting it to enable or disable this final validation check, depending on their testing requirements.|
|AddrWidth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>`AddrWidth` determines the bit-width required to address the entries within the FIFO. It is calculated based on the `Depth` parameter, which specifies the number of entries in the FIFO. This parameter ensures that the addressing logic can uniquely identify each entry in the FIFO, allowing for efficient data storage and retrieval. Users interact with this parameter indirectly by setting the `Depth`, which in turn influences the `AddrWidth`. For example, if the FIFO is configured to hold a larger number of entries, `AddrWidth` will increase to accommodate the additional addressing requirements. This parameter is crucial for ensuring that the FIFO can handle the specified number of entries without address conflicts.|
|CountWidth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>`CountWidth` determines the bit-width required to represent the number of entries in the FIFO, ranging from 0 to `Depth`. It is crucial for managing the FIFO's capacity and ensuring accurate tracking of the number of items stored. Users interact with this parameter indirectly through signals like `push_slots` and `pop_items`, which utilize `CountWidth` to convey the current status of the FIFO. For example, if `Depth` is set to a higher value, `CountWidth` automatically adjusts to accommodate the increased range, ensuring that the FIFO can handle the specified number of entries without overflow. This parameter is essential for maintaining the integrity of FIFO operations, especially in scenarios where precise tracking of stored items is critical.|
|CreditWidth|**Type:** `int`.<br><br> **Purpose of the Parameter**:  <br>The `CreditWidth` parameter determines the bit-width of the credit counter used in the FIFO design. It is crucial for managing the number of credits available for push operations, ensuring that the FIFO does not overflow. Users interact with this parameter indirectly by configuring related parameters such as `MaxCredit`, which influences the maximum count the credit counter can reach. The `CreditWidth` ensures that the credit counter can accurately represent the range of credit values needed for the FIFO's operation, accommodating the maximum credit limit and any additional credits withheld or initially provided. This parameter is essential for maintaining the integrity of the credit-based flow control mechanism, allowing the FIFO to handle varying data rates and backpressure conditions effectively.|

### End-to-End Functionality
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Data Transfer Between Clock Domains|The design facilitates the transfer of data from the push interface to the pop interface across different clock domains. It uses `push_valid` and `push_data` to initiate data transfer into the FIFO, while monitoring `push_credit_stall` to determine if the push operation can proceed without stalling. On the pop side, `pop_ready` indicates readiness to receive data. When `pop_ready` is asserted, the design checks for available data and asserts `pop_valid` to signal that valid data is ready to be read, transferring it to `pop_data`. The FIFO status is updated using `push_full` and `pop_empty`, and the number of available slots and items is tracked with `push_slots` and `pop_items`. The design ensures efficient data transfer by respecting the credit system managed by `credit_initial_push`, `credit_withhold_push`, `credit_count_push`, and `credit_available_push`. It performs the transfer while respecting the asynchronous nature of the clock domains, using the specified number of synchronization stages (`NumSyncStages`).|
|Credit-Based Flow Control|The design manages data flow using a credit-based system to prevent overflow and ensure efficient data handling. It initializes the credit system with `credit_initial_push` and uses `credit_withhold_push` to control the withholding of credits under specific conditions. The design continuously updates `credit_count_push` to track the number of credits used, while `credit_available_push` indicates the remaining credits available for pushing data. This credit system ensures that data is only pushed when sufficient credits are available, preventing overflow. The design dynamically adjusts the credit count based on the push and pop operations, maintaining a balance between data flow and resource availability.|
