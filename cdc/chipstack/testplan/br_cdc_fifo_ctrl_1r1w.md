|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|BasicPushPopFunctionality|Check that the FIFO correctly handles data flow by pushing data until it is full and then popping data until it is empty, while updating its status signals accordingly.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_rst` and monitors `push_ready`. Check that the design eventually drives `push_ready` low, indicating the FIFO is not ready to accept data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench deasserts `push_rst` and monitors `push_ready`. Check that the design eventually drives `push_ready` high, indicating the FIFO is ready to accept data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench drives `push_valid` high with valid data on `push_data` (width defined by `Width`) and monitors `push_ready`. Check that the design eventually drives `push_ready` high, indicating the data is accepted.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Repeat the previous step until the testbench monitors `push_full`. Check that the design eventually drives `push_full` high, indicating the FIFO is full.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` and monitors `pop_valid`. Check that the design eventually drives `pop_valid` high, indicating valid data is available to pop.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench reads `pop_data` (width defined by `Width`) and monitors `pop_empty`. Check that the design eventually drives `pop_empty` high, indicating the FIFO is empty.  <br><br>|
|PushBackpressureHandling|Check that the FIFO correctly manages `push_valid` and `push_data` stability when `push_ready` is deasserted due to backpressure, ensuring no data overflow occurs when `push_full` is asserted.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_rst` to reset the FIFO and waits for the design to eventually drive `push_ready` low, indicating the FIFO is not ready to accept data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench deasserts `push_rst` and waits for the design to eventually drive `push_ready` high, indicating the FIFO is ready to accept data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench drives `push_valid` high with valid data on `push_data` and waits for the design to eventually drive `push_ready` high, confirming readiness to accept the data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench continues to drive `push_valid` high with new data on `push_data` until the design eventually drives `push_full` high, indicating the FIFO is full.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench continues to drive `push_valid` high and monitors `push_ready`, waiting for it to be deasserted due to backpressure, confirming that the FIFO cannot accept more data.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench ensures `push_valid` and `push_data` remain stable while `push_ready` is low, verifying data stability under backpressure conditions.  <br><br>|
|PopLatencyVerification|Check that the FIFO correctly handles read latency during pop operations by managing `pop_valid` and `pop_data` timing based on the `RamReadLatency` parameter.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_rst` and `pop_rst` to reset the FIFO and monitors `pop_empty`. Check that the design eventually drives `pop_empty` high.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench deasserts `push_rst` and `pop_rst`, generates data using `$urandom_range(0, MaxRandomValue)`, and pushes it into the FIFO. The testbench monitors `pop_empty`. Check that the design eventually drives `pop_empty` low.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` and monitors `pop_valid`. Check that the design eventually drives `pop_valid` high, indicating valid data is available.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench reads `pop_data` and monitors `pop_valid`. Check that the design drives `pop_valid` low after the expected `RamReadLatency` cycles, where `RamReadLatency` is calculated as `FlopRamAddressDepthStages + FlopRamReadDataDepthStages + FlopRamReadDataWidthStages`.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench verifies that the timing of `pop_valid` and `pop_data` aligns with the configured `RamReadLatency`.  <br><br>|
|CrossDomainSynchronization|Check that the FIFO correctly synchronizes data between `push_clk` and `pop_clk` domains without data corruption, ensuring proper handling of synchronization across different clock domains.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench drives `push_valid` high with valid data on `push_data` of width `Width` and monitors for the design to eventually drive `push_ready` high.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` and monitors for the design to eventually drive `pop_valid` high, indicating valid data is available.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench verifies that data integrity is maintained across clock domains by comparing the `push_data` driven by the testbench with the `pop_data` driven by the design, ensuring they match.  <br><br>|
|ResetBehaviorVerification|Check that the FIFO correctly resets its internal state and outputs when `push_rst` and `pop_rst` are asserted, and resumes normal operation with data integrity after reset.  <br><br> <h3>Steps</h3><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `push_rst` and `pop_rst` to reset the FIFO and waits for the design to drive `push_ready` low and `pop_empty` high. The testbench monitors `push_ready` and `pop_empty` to confirm the reset state.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench deasserts `push_rst` and `pop_rst` and waits for the design to drive `push_ready` high and `pop_empty` low after pushing data. The testbench monitors `push_ready` and `pop_empty` to confirm readiness for operation.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench verifies that all internal counters and status signals are reset to their initial values by monitoring the design's output signals.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench drives `push_valid` high with valid data on `push_data` using a stable data pattern, considering `EnableAssertPushDataStability` if enabled, and waits for the design to drive `push_ready` high. The testbench monitors `push_ready` to confirm data acceptance.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench asserts `pop_ready` and waits for the design to drive `pop_valid` high, indicating valid data is available. The testbench monitors `pop_valid` to confirm data availability.  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - The testbench verifies that the FIFO resumes normal operation after reset, with data integrity maintained by monitoring the data output and comparing it with the expected pattern.  <br><br>|
