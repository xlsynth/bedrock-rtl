# ACTION REQUIRED:
#
# This file provides some defaults for required Bazel flags. You will probably want to override
# them in your own custom user.bazelrc file (included at the end of this file).

# Special environment setup commands that may be needed for your EDA tool environment.
# The environment variable must be set to some string even if it's empty.
common --action_env=VERILOG_RUNNER_EDA_TOOLS_ENV_SETUP=""

# Please implement verilog runner plugins for tools and then set in your user.bazelrc file:
#
#     common --action_env=VERILOG_RUNNER_PLUGIN_PATH=<some_paths>
#
#   Otherwise, tests will fail due to missing elab, lint, sim, fpv plugins.
#   See //python/verilog_runner/README.adoc.
#
# The environment variable must be set to some string even if it's empty.
common --action_env=VERILOG_RUNNER_PLUGIN_PATH=""

# Slang is used by TopStitch to build some wrapper RTL files for elab and lint testing.
common --action_env=SLANG_PATH=""

# If needed, set the path to locally installed XLS libraries (needed by TopStitch).
#common --linkopt=-L/opt/xlsynth/lib
#common --linkopt=-Wl,-rpath,/opt/xlsynth/lib
#common --host_linkopt=-L/opt/xlsynth/lib
#common --host_linkopt=-Wl,-rpath,/opt/xlsynth/lib

# The following flags are used by Bazel to self-throttle the number of concurrent
# jobs that can run for a given proprietary license-limited EDA tool.
# However, this doesn't limit the use of licenses by other workflows that may exist
# outside of this Bazel workspace.
#
# The values for each of these flags must be set to some integer >= 1 or the Bazel
# Verilog test rules will crash.
#
# Set the values to match the number of EDA tool licenses available in your environment.
# If you don't want limits, set the values to some large positive number.
#
# See TOOLS_THAT_NEED_LICENSES in //bazel/verilog.bzl for the list of tools that need licenses.
# The form of the flag is:
#
#     common --local_resources=verilog_test_tool_licenses_<tool_name>=<number>
common --local_resources=verilog_test_tool_licenses_ascentlint=10000
common --local_resources=verilog_test_tool_licenses_jg=10000
common --local_resources=verilog_test_tool_licenses_vcf=10000
common --local_resources=verilog_test_tool_licenses_vcs=10000
