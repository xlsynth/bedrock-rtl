WARNING: UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Everything is broken.

High quality and composable base RTL libraries in Verilog

== Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed in your environment.

* Bazel (tested with 7.3.1)
* pre-commit (tested with 3.8.0)
* Your own EDA tools (for running tests)

#TODO(mgottscho): Add more as we implement more things.#

== Pre-Commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality. To install the hooks, run:

[source,shell]
----
pre-commit install
----

They should automatically run on every commit.
You can also run them manually via:

[source,shell]
----
pre-commit run
----

== Building and Testing

:bazel: https://bazel.build/

We use the powerful {bazel}[Bazel^] build system to assemble filelists and to run all tests (elaboration, lint, simulation, and formal).

A one-step command builds and runs all tests:

[source,shell]
----
bazel test //...
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Action required for tests to pass!
====
By default, the Bazel tests will fail because they call a placeholder wrapper script that does not reference any particular vendor EDA tool.
We do this because:

1. We want to keep test definitions as vendor-agnostic as possible.
2. Certain vendors may have non-disclosure agreements that protect usage of their APIs or licensing agreements that restrict where and how the tools can be run.

You will need to point Bazel to a "real" implementation of the wrapper script to be able to run the tests.
====

The Bazel test rule implementations at `//bazel:verilog.bzl` shell out to a program with a generic EDA vendor tool-agnostic API that actually implements the test.
By default, a placeholder tool called `placeholder_verilog_runner.py` is used. It implements the argument parsing part of the API but does nothing other than fail the test.
This placeholder test is generated by Bazel during the build with `//bazel:write_placeholder_verilog_runner_py.bzl`.

To use a real implementation of the script, you tell Bazel where to find it by setting `--action_env=BAZEL_VERILOG_RUNNER_TOOL=/path/to/your/verilog_runner.py` on the command line or in the `.bazelrc` file.

== Continuous Integration

Using GitHub Actions, which currently just runs pre-commit checks.

#TODO(mgottscho): Find a way to have CI run Bazel tests using real EDA tools.#

== Style Guide

:xlsynth-verilog-style-guide: https://github.com/xlsynth/verilog-style-guides/blob/master/VerilogCodingStyle.md
:lowrisc-verilog-style-guide: https://github.com/lowrisc/verilog-style-guides/blob/master/VerilogCodingStyle.md

We follow the {xlsynth-verilog-style-guide}[xlsynth Verilog Style Guide^], which is a fork of the {lowrisc-verilog-style-guide}[lowRISC style guide^] with some minor differences.

== Bazel Rules for Verilog

This repository defines several generally-helpful Bazel Verilog rules that you can use in your own projects.

=== `verilog_library` (external)

:verilog-library: https://github.com/hdl/bazel_rules_hdl/blob/main/verilog/providers.bzl

The `verilog_library` rule is used to collect Verilog source and header files and track their dependencies.
The original definition of the `verilog_library` rule can be found {verilog-library}[here^].
We pick up that rule dependency transitively (see the top-level `MODULE.bazel`).

.Using `verilog_library`
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bazel]
----
load("@rules_hdl//verilog:providers.bzl", "verilog_library")

verilog_library(
    name = "bar",
    srcs = ["bar.sv"],
    hdrs = ["baz.svh"]
)

verilog_library(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["foo.sv"],
    deps = [":bar"],
)
----
====

== Other rules

Please see link:bazel/verilog_rules.md[] for documentation on rules defined in this repository.

== Using Bedrock

:bzlmod: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.1.0/bzlmod.html

Usage is best illustrated with an example using the {bzlmod}[bzlmod^] dependency management system in Bazel.

TIP: You are not required to use Bazel to depend on Bedrock-RTL.
You can also use the Verilog files directly in your own projects (e.g., with git submodule, git subtree, or some other method).

In your project's `MODULE.bazel`:

.`MODULE.bazel`
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bzl]
----
module(name = "your-project")

bazel_dep(name = "bedrock-rtl", version = "0.0.1")
git_override(
    module_name = "bedrock-rtl",
    commit = <fill_in_git_commit_sha>,
    remote = "https://github.com/xlsynth/bedrock-rtl",
)

rules_hdl_extension = use_extension("@bedrock-rtl//dependency_support/rules_hdl:extension.bzl", "rules_hdl_extension")
use_repo(rules_hdl_extension, "rules_hdl")
----
====

Then suppose you have the following SystemVerilog module called `datapath_join.sv`:

.`datapath_join.sv`
[%collapsible]

[source,verilog]

// An example design using two Bedrock-RTL modules: br_flow_reg_fwd and br_flow_join.

// Uses ready/valid protocol on all flows.
// Push-side is registered.

`include "br_asserts.svh"

module datapath_join #(
    parameter int NumFlows = 2,  // must be at least 2
    parameter int BitWidthPerFlow = 32  // must be at least 1

  `BR_ASSERT_STATIC(numflows_gte_2_a, NumFlows >= 2)
  `BR_ASSERT_STATIC(bitwidthperflow_gte_1_a, BitWidthPerFlow >= 1)

  logic [NumFlows-1:0] inter_ready;
  logic [NumFlows-1:0] inter_valid;
  logic [NumFlows-1:0][BitWidthPerFlow-1:0] inter_data;

  for (genvar i = 0; i < NumFlows; i++) begin : gen_regs
    br_flow_reg_fwd #(
        .BitWidth(BitWidthPerFlow)
    ) br_flow_reg_fwd (
        .clk,
        .rst,
        .push_ready(push_ready[i]),
        .push_valid(push_valid[i]),
        .push_data (push_data[i]),
        .pop_ready (inter_ready[i]),
        .pop_valid (inter_valid[i]),
        .pop_data  (inter_data[i])
    );
  end

  br_flow_join #(
      .NumFlows(NumFlows)
  ) br_flow_join (
      .clk,
      .rst,
      .push_ready(inter_ready),
      .push_valid(inter_valid),

      .pop_valid (pop_valid)
  );

  assign pop_data = inter_data;  // direct concat

== `macros`: Macros and Defines

=== `br_registers.svh`: Flip-Flop Inference Macros

These macros conveniently wrap `always_ff` blocks, improving readability and helping to structure user code into sequential and combinational portions.
The macros are named according to the following suffix convention.

* `A`: Asynchronous reset (if absent, then synchronous)
* `I`: Initial value given (if absent, then 0)
* `L`: Conditional load enable (if absent, then unconditional)
* `N`: No reset (if absent, then reset)
* `X`: Given explicit clock and reset names (if absent, then `clk` and either `rst` if synchronous or `arst` if asynchronous)

IMPORTANT: Clocks are always positive-edge triggered.
Resets are always active-high.
