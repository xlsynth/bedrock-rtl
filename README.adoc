WARNING: UNDER CONSTRUCTION. Many things are broken.

High quality and composable base RTL libraries in Verilog

== Dependencies

At minimum, you need to have the following tools installed in your environment.

* Bazel (tested with 7.3.1)
* System Python interpreter (tested with 3.12.5)

You can use the provided Dockerfile to build a container image with the above dependencies installed.
For example:

[source,shell]
----
docker build . --target user --tag=bedrock-rtl:${USER}
docker run -v $(pwd):/src -w /src bedrock-rtl:${USER} <YOUR_COMMAND>
----

You need to provide your own EDA tool plugins that implement the plugin API for `verilog_runner.py`.

#TODO: Add support for open-source EDA tools. iverilog would be nice but it does not support macros with arguments.#

== Pre-Commit Hooks

We use pre-commit hooks to enforce basic coding style.
To install the hooks, run:

[source,shell]
----
pre-commit install
----

They should automatically run on every commit.
You can also run them manually via:

[source,shell]
----
pre-commit run
----

We've tested with pre-commit version 4.0.1.

== Building and Testing

:bazel: https://bazel.build/

We use the powerful {bazel}[Bazel^] build system to assemble filelists and to run all tests (elaboration, lint, simulation, and formal).

A one-step command builds and runs all tests:

[source,shell]
----
bazel test //...
----

[IMPORTANT]
.Action required for tests to pass!
====
By default, the Bazel tests will fail because the repository does not currently provide any EDA tool plugins for the `verilog_runner.py` tool.
We do this because:

1. We want to keep test definitions as vendor-agnostic as possible.
2. Certain vendors may have non-disclosure agreements that protect usage of their APIs or licensing agreements that restrict where and how the tools can be run.

You will need to implement the plugin API by subclassing `//python/verilog_runner/eda_tool.py` for the tool(s) of interest and then point to them with the `VERILOG_RUNNER_PLUGIN_PATH` environment variable.
You should also set this environment variable in the `.bazelrc` file so that it is used in all Bazel test invocations.
====

The Bazel test rule implementations at `//bazel:verilog.bzl` shell out the `//python/verilog_runner/verilog_runner.py` tool that presents a generic tool-agnostic API that actually implements the test.

== Continuous Integration

Using GitHub Actions, which currently just runs pre-commit checks.

#TODO(mgottscho): Find a way to have CI run Bazel tests using real EDA tools.#

== Style Guide

:xlsynth-verilog-style-guide: https://github.com/xlsynth/verilog-style-guides/blob/master/VerilogCodingStyle.md
:lowrisc-verilog-style-guide: https://github.com/lowrisc/verilog-style-guides/blob/master/VerilogCodingStyle.md

We follow the {xlsynth-verilog-style-guide}[xlsynth Verilog Style Guide^], which is a fork of the {lowrisc-verilog-style-guide}[lowRISC style guide^] with some minor differences.

== Bazel Rules for Verilog

This repository defines several generally-helpful Bazel Verilog rules that you can use in your own projects.

=== `verilog_library` (external)

:verilog-library: https://github.com/hdl/bazel_rules_hdl/blob/main/verilog/providers.bzl

The `verilog_library` rule is used to collect Verilog source and header files and track their dependencies.
The original definition of the `verilog_library` rule can be found {verilog-library}[here^].
We pick up that rule dependency transitively (see the top-level `MODULE.bazel`).

.Using `verilog_library`
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bazel]
----
load("@rules_hdl//verilog:providers.bzl", "verilog_library")

verilog_library(
    name = "bar",
    srcs = ["bar.sv"],
    hdrs = ["baz.svh"]
)

verilog_library(
    name = "foo",
    srcs = ["foo.sv"],
    deps = [":bar"],
)
----
====

== Other rules

Please see link:bazel/verilog_rules.md[] for documentation on rules defined in this repository.

== Using Bedrock

:bzlmod: https://docs.bazel.build/versions/5.1.0/bzlmod.html

Usage is best illustrated with an example using the {bzlmod}[bzlmod^] dependency management system in Bazel.

TIP: You are not required to use Bazel to depend on Bedrock-RTL.
You can also use the Verilog files directly in your own projects (e.g., with git submodule, git subtree, or some other method).

In your project's `MODULE.bazel`:

.`MODULE.bazel`
[%collapsible]
====
[source,bzl]
----
module(name = "your-project")

bazel_dep(name = "bedrock-rtl", version = "0.0.1")
git_override(
    module_name = "bedrock-rtl",
    commit = <fill_in_git_commit_sha>,
    remote = "https://github.com/xlsynth/bedrock-rtl",
)

rules_hdl_extension = use_extension("@bedrock-rtl//dependency_support/rules_hdl:extension.bzl", "rules_hdl_extension")
use_repo(rules_hdl_extension, "rules_hdl")
----

Then suppose you have the following SystemVerilog module called `datapath_join.sv`:

.`datapath_join.sv`
[%collapsible]

[source,verilog]
----
// An example design using two Bedrock-RTL modules: br_flow_reg_fwd and br_flow_join.

// Push-side is registered.

  logic [NumFlows-1:0] inter_ready;
  logic [NumFlows-1:0] inter_valid;
  logic [NumFlows-1:0][WidthPerFlow-1:0] inter_data;

  for (genvar i = 0; i < NumFlows; i++) begin : gen_regs
    br_flow_reg_fwd #(
        .Width(WidthPerFlow)
    ) br_flow_reg_fwd (
        .clk,
        .rst,
        .push_ready(push_ready[i]),
        .push_valid(push_valid[i]),
        .push_data (push_data[i]),
        .pop_ready (inter_ready[i]),
        .pop_valid (inter_valid[i]),
        .pop_data  (inter_data[i])
    );
  end

  br_flow_join #(
      .NumFlows(NumFlows)
  ) br_flow_join (
      .clk,
      .rst,
      .push_ready(inter_ready),
      .push_valid(inter_valid),
      .pop_ready (pop_ready),
      .pop_valid (pop_valid)
  );

  assign pop_data = inter_data;  // direct concat

== `macros`: Macros and Defines

=== `br_registers.svh`: Flip-Flop Inference Macros

These macros conveniently wrap `always_ff` blocks, improving readability and helping to structure user code into sequential and combinational portions.
The macros are named according to the following suffix convention.

* `A`: Asynchronous reset (if absent, then synchronous)
* `I`: Initial value given (if absent, then 0)
* `L`: Conditional load enable (if absent, then unconditional)
* `N`: No reset (if absent, then reset)
* `X`: Given explicit clock and reset names (if absent, then `clk` and either `rst` if synchronous or `arst` if asynchronous)

IMPORTANT: Clocks are always positive-edge triggered.
Resets are always active-high.

NOTE: The order of the suffices generally matches the order of the arguments to the macro.
The suffices are also listed in alphabetical order, with the exception of `L` before `I`.

=== `br_asserts.svh`: Public Assertions

These assertion macros are intended for use by the user in their own designs.
They are guarded (enabled) by the following defines:

* `BR_ASSERT_ON` -- if not defined, then all assertion macros are no-ops.
* `BR_DISABLE_ASSERT_COMB` -- if defined, then all BR_ASSERT_COMB* macros are no-ops.
* `BR_DISABLE_FINAL_CHECKS` -- if defined, then the BR_ASSERT_FINAL macro is a no-op.

TIP: It is recommended that users simply define `BR_ASSERT_ON` when integrating Bedrock modules into their designs.
The other guards will typically not be necessary.

IMPORTANT: Clocks are always positive-edge triggered.
Resets are always active-high.

[cols="2,4"]
|===
| Macro/define | Description

| `BR_ASSERT_STATIC`
| Static (elaboration-time) assertion for use within modules

| `BR_ASSERT_STATIC_IN_PACKAGE`

Disable by defining `BR_DISABLE_FINAL_CHECKS`.

| `BR_ASSERT`
| Concurrent assertion with implicit `clk` and `rst` names.

| `BR_ASSERT_CR`
| Concurrent assertion with explicit clock and reset names.

| `BR_ASSERT_COMB`
a| Combinational/immediate assertion. Also passes if the expression is unknown.
Disable by defining `BR_DISABLE_ASSERT_COMB`.

| Concurrent cover with implicit `clk` and `rst` names.

| `BR_COVER_CR`
| Concurrent cover with explicit clock and reset names.

| `BR_COVER_COMB`
| Combinational/immediate cover.

| Concurrent assumption with implicit `clk` and `rst` names.

| `BR_ASSUME_CR`
| Concurrent assumption with explicit clock and reset names.

a| Concurrent assertion that is active in reset and out of reset
(but specifically intended for checking the former), with implicit `clk` name.

| `BR_ASSERT_IN_RESET_C`
a| Concurrent assertion that is active in reset and out of reset
(but specifically intended for checking the former), with explicit clock name.

==== FPV-only Wrappers

These assertion macros are intended for use in formal verification monitors that might
be integrated into a simulation environment, but where not all formal assertions should be used in simulation.
They are guarded (enabled) by the following defines:

* `BR_ENABLE_FPV` -- if not defined, then all BR_*_FPV macros are no-ops.

[cols="2,4"]
|===
| Macro/define | Description

| `BR_ASSERT_FPV`
| Wraps BR_ASSERT.

| `BR_ASSERT_CR_FPV`
| Wraps BR_ASSERT_CR.

|===

=== `br_asserts_internal.svh`: Bedrock-internal Assertions

These assertion macros wrap the public assertions.
They are intended only for internal use inside Bedrock libraries, but the user needs to know about them.
They are guarded (enabled) by the following defines:

The macros in this file are guarded with the following defines.
* `BR_DISABLE_INTG_CHECKS` -- if defined, then all the BR_*_INTG checks are no-ops.
* `BR_ENABLE_IMPL_CHECKS` -- if not defined, then all the BR_*_IMPL checks are no-ops.

The intent is that users should not need to do anything, so that by default they will get only
the integration checks but not the implementation checks.

TIP: All of these macros wrap the public macros in `br_asserts.svh`, so they are also subject to the same global defines such as `BR_ASSERT_ON`.

==== Integration Checks

These checks are meant for checking the integration of a library module into an end user's design.
