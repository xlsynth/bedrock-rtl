High quality and composable base RTL libraries in Verilog

== Prerequisites

You need to have the following tools installed in your environment.

* Bazel 6 or later
* Verible (tested with v0.0-3798-ga602f072 commit 2024-09-23, YMMV)
* TODO(mgottscho): Add more as we implement more things

== Testing

[source,shell]
----
bazel test //...
----

If you get a lint test error, go fix the code.
If you get a format test error, you can automatically fix via:

[source,shell]
----
verible-verilog-format --inplace <file1.sv> <file2.sv> ...
----

#TODO(mgottscho): Improve the formatter to be more user-friendly. Details in bazel/verilog.bzl.#

== Continuous Integration

Using GitHub Actions, which currently just runs Verible lint and format tests.
