## Formal Unit Test Scenarios
### File: ./delay/rtl/br_delay_nr.sv

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Reset Value of 'out'|Check that if: rst was set to '0' and then rises back to '1', then: out is undefined immediately.|
|Immediate Pass-Through|Cover that: when `in` is set to a specific value, `out` immediately equals `in`.|
|Delayed Output|Cover that: when `in` is set to a specific value, `out` equals `in` after many clock cycles.|
|Data Integrity Verification|Clock and Reset Group, Data Group|
|Pass-through Functionality|Check that if `NumStages = 0` and `in` changes, then `out` equals `in` immediately.|
|Delay Functionality|Check that if `NumStages > 0` and `in` changes, then `out` equals `in` after NumStages clock cycles.|
|Pipeline Progression|Check that if `in` changes, then `out` reflects the change after many clock cycles.|
|Zero Delay Check|Check that if: NumStages is 0, then: out immediately equals in on every clock cycle.|
|Non-zero Delay Check|Check that if: NumStages is greater than 0, then: out equals in after many clock cycles, specifically after NumStages cycles.|
|Bit Width Consistency|Check that: the width of out always matches the width of in.|
