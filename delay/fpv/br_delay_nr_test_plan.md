## Formal Unit Test Scenarios
### File: ./delay/rtl/br_delay_nr.sv

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Immediate Reflection for Zero Stages|Check that if: NumStages is 0 and clk rises, then: out equals in immediately.|
|Delayed Reflection for Non-Zero Stages|Check that if: NumStages is greater than 0, after an initial one-time delay of NumStages cycles, and clk rises, then: out equals in from NumStages cycles ago.|
