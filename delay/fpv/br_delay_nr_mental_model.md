## Formal Unit Test Mental Model
### File: ./delay/rtl/br_delay_nr.sv

### Module Summaries

### br_delay_nr
The `br_delay_nr` module is designed to delay an input signal by a specified number of clock cycles, determined by the parameter `NumStages`. Its primary functionality is to pass the input signal through a series of pipeline registers, effectively delaying the signal by the number of stages specified, without any reset functionality for the registers.

### Clock Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|clk|The type of this port is: logic.  The signal "clk" is a clock signal. It is an input port in the RTL top-level module and is used to synchronize the operations within the module, such as sampling the input and progressing data through the pipeline stages.|

### Reset Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|rst|The type of this port is: logic.  The reset functionality of port `rst` in this design is not used for resetting the pipeline registers. It is only used for assertions. Therefore, the reset signal does not affect the behavior of the design in terms of delaying the input signal. The reset is synchronous active-high.|

### Input Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|in|The type of this port is: `logic[BitWidth-1:0]`.  The port `in` serves as the input signal for the design. When `NumStages = 0`, `in` is directly passed to `out` without delay, acting as a pass-through. When `NumStages > 0`, `in` is delayed by the specified number of clock cycles before appearing at `out`. The width of `in` is determined by the `BitWidth` parameter, which must be at least 1. The design does not reset the pipeline registers, so the input signal will propagate through the stages based on the clock cycles, unaffected by any reset signal.|

### Output Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|out|The type of this port is: `logic[BitWidth-1:0]`.  - The `out` port reflects the delayed or immediate value of the `in` signal based on `NumStages`. - If `NumStages = 0`, `out` immediately equals `in`, with no delay. - If `NumStages > 0`, `out` equals `in` delayed by `NumStages` clock cycles. - Upon reset, `out` is undefined.|

### Design Parameters
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|NumStages|The type of this parameter is: int.  The configuration parameter `NumStages` determines the number of clock cycles by which the input signal `in` is delayed before appearing at the output `out`. When `NumStages` is set to 0, the design functions as a pass-through, meaning `out` immediately reflects `in` with no delay. For values greater than 0, `out` is delayed by the specified number of clock cycles, corresponding to the value of `NumStages`. This parameter allows users to configure the delay behavior of the design.|
|BitWidth|The type of this parameter is: int.  The configuration parameter `BitWidth` determines the width of the input and output signals, `in` and `out`. It specifies the number of bits used to represent these signals, ensuring they can accommodate the desired data size. This parameter must be set to at least 1 to ensure valid signal representation.|

### Basic Functionality
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Pass-through action|The goal of this function is to directly pass the input signal to the output without any delay. The input for this function is `in` when `NumStages = 0`. The expected output is `out`, which will be equal to `in` immediately, with no delay.|
|Delay action|The goal of this function is to delay the input signal by a specified number of clock cycles. The input for this function is `in` when `NumStages > 0`. The expected output is `out`, which will be equal to the input signal `in` delayed by `NumStages` clock cycles. The delay type is many cycles, corresponding to the value of `NumStages`.|

### Corner Case Functionality
|Condition|Expected Behavior|Handling Mechanism|
|---|---|---|
|NumStages is 0|The output 'out' is directly equal to the input 'in'.|The design assigns 'in' directly to 'out' without any delay.|
|NumStages is greater than 0|The output 'out' is the input 'in' delayed by 'NumStages' clock cycles.|The design uses a series of registers to delay the input signal by 'NumStages' cycles before assigning it to 'out'.|
