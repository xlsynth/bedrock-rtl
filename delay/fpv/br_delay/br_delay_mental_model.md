## Formal Unit Test Mental Model
### File: ./delay/rtl/br_delay.sv

### SUMMARY

#### Module Instantiation Hierarchy:
- br_delay

#### Module Summary Table:
| Module | Summary |
|--------|---------|
| br_delay (Top Level) | The `br_delay` module is designed to delay an input signal by a specified number of clock cycles, determined by the `NumStages` parameter. Its primary functionality is to use a series of pipeline registers to achieve this delay, with the output reflecting the input after the set number of cycles, or immediately if `NumStages` is zero. |

### Clock Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|clk|The type of this port is: logic.  The clock functionality of port `clk` is rising edge (posedge) triggered. Users interact with it by providing a clock signal that synchronizes the delayed operation when `NumStages` is greater than 0. The expected behavior is that the pipeline stages update on the rising edge of `clk`, ensuring the output `out` reflects the input `in` from `NumStages` cycles ago.|

### Reset Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|rst|The type of this port is: logic.  The reset functionality of port `rst` is active high.|

### Input Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|in|The type of this port is: logic[Width-1:0].  The `in` port is a logic vector with a width defined by the `Width` parameter, which must be at least 1. It serves as the input signal to the module. When `NumStages` is 0, the `in` signal is directly passed to the `out` port without delay, behaving as a combinatorial path. When `NumStages` is greater than 0, the `in` signal is delayed by the specified number of clock cycles, with the `out` port reflecting the `in` signal from `NumStages` cycles ago. The `clk` signal is used to clock the pipeline stages for the delayed operation.|

### Output Ports
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|out|The type of this port is: logic[Width-1:0].  - The `out` port reflects the input `in` directly when `NumStages` is 0, acting as a passthrough. - When `NumStages` is greater than 0, `out` represents the value of `in` from `NumStages` cycles ago. - Upon reset, `out` = 0.|

### Design Parameters
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Width|The type of this parameter is: int.  The configuration parameter `Width` determines the width of the input and output signals in the design. It specifies the number of bits for both `in` and `out`, ensuring they match in size. This parameter allows users to configure the design to handle signals of varying bit widths, accommodating different data sizes as required by the application.|
|NumStages|The type of this parameter is: int.  The configuration parameter `NumStages` determines the number of clock cycles by which the input signal `in` is delayed before appearing at the output `out`. When `NumStages` is set to 0, the design functions as a passthrough, meaning `out` is equal to `in` in the same cycle. When `NumStages` is greater than 0, the input signal is delayed by the specified number of cycles, with `out` reflecting the value of `in` from `NumStages` cycles ago.|

### Basic Functionality
|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Passthrough Operation|The goal of this operation is to directly pass the input signal to the output without any delay. This occurs when `NumStages` is 0. The control signals involved are `clk` and `rst`, but they do not affect the operation as it is combinatorial. The expected behavior is that `out` is equal to `in` in the same cycle.|
|Delayed Operation|The goal of this operation is to delay the input signal by a specified number of clock cycles. This occurs when `NumStages` is greater than 0. The control signal `clk` is used to clock the pipeline stages. The expected behavior is that `out` will be equal to the input `in` from `NumStages` cycles ago. The operation outcome is updated after many cycles, specifically after `NumStages` cycles.|
