## Formal Unit Test Scenarios
### File: ./delay/rtl/br_delay.sv

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|Reset Value of 'out'|Check that if: 'rst' is set to '1' and then falls back to '0', then: 'out' is '0' on the following cycle.|
|Passthrough Operation|Check that if: NumStages = 0 then: out = in immediately.|
|Delayed Operation|Check that if: NumStages > 0 and an initial one-time delay of NumStages cycles, then: out equals the past value of in from NumStages cycles ago.|
