= Bedrock-RTL Delay Line (With Valid) Specification

== Overview

The `br_delay_valid` module implements a configurable delay line with a valid signal.
It delays an input data signal `in` along with its associated valid signal `in_valid` by a fixed number of clock cycles specified by the `NumStages` parameter.
The delayed data and valid signals are output on `out` and `out_valid`, respectively.
If `NumStages` is 0, the outputs `out` and `out_valid` are directly connected to the inputs `in` and `in_valid` without any delay.

The valid signals are reset synchronously to 0 upon assertion of the reset signal `rst`, ensuring that the pipeline stages start in a known state.
The data path registers are not reset and their contents are undefined upon reset.
Each data path register is clock-gated using its corresponding valid signal to prevent unnecessary switching activity when the valid signal is not asserted.

== Parameters

[cols="1,1,1,3"]

| Parameter | Type | Scope | Description

| `Width`
| `int`
| module

== Interfaces

[cols="1,1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Interface | Port Direction | Port Type | Port Name | Description

| Clock
| `input`
| `logic`
| `clk`
| Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.

| Reset
| `input`
| `logic`
| `rst`
| Synchronous active-high reset signal. Resets all valid pipeline registers to 0.

| Data Input Valid
| `input`
| `logic`
| `in_valid`
| Indicates that the input data `in` is valid.

| Data Input
| `input`
| `logic [Width-1:0]`
| `in`
| Input data signal to be delayed.

| Data Output Valid
| `output`
| `logic`
| `out_valid`
| Indicates that the output data `out` is valid.

| Data Output
| `output`
| `logic [Width-1:0]`
| `out`
| Delayed output data signal.

== Functional Behavior

* Upon assertion of the reset signal `rst`, all `valid` pipeline registers are reset to 0 synchronously on the rising edge of `clk`.
The data path registers are not reset and retain their previous values (which may be undefined initially).
* After reset is deasserted, the module delays the input data `in` and its associated valid signal `in_valid` by `NumStages` clock cycles.
* For each clock cycle after reset deassertion:
  ** The valid signal `in_valid` is propagated through the pipeline stages.
  ** If `in_valid` is asserted (high), the input data `in` is propagated through the pipeline stages.
  ** Each data path register is clock-gated using its preceding valid signal to prevent unnecessary toggling when the data is not valid.
  ** The valid signal `out_valid` at the output reflects the delayed version of `in_valid`:
    *** `out_valid(t) = in_valid(t - NumStages)` for `t â‰¥ NumStages`.
  ** When `out_valid` is asserted (high), the output data `out` reflects the delayed version of `in`:
    *** `out(t) = in(t - NumStages)` for the cycles where `out_valid` is high.
  ** When `out_valid` is deasserted (low), the corresponding data path register is not updated.
     The user should consider its value to be undefined and must take care to never inspect an invalid value.


== Latency and Throughput

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Latency Metric | Cycles | Description

| Data and Valid Delay
| `NumStages`
| The outputs `out_valid` and `out` reflect the inputs `in_valid` and `in` delayed by `NumStages` clock cycles.

| Throughput
| 1
| The module can accept and process a new valid input every clock cycle.

| Reset Latency
| 1
| After asserting `rst`, the valid pipeline registers are reset to 0 on the next rising edge of `clk`.
