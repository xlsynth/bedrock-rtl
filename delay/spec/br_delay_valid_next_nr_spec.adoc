= Bedrock-RTL Delay Line (With Valid-Next, No Reset) Specification

== Overview

The `br_delay_valid_next_nr` module implements a configurable delay line with a valid-next signal, similar to `br_delay_valid_next`, but without a reset affecting the internal valid-next pipeline registers.
It delays an input data signal `in` along with its associated valid-next signal `in_valid_next` by a fixed number of clock cycles specified by the `NumStages` parameter.
The delayed data and valid-next signals are output on `out` and `out_valid_next`, respectively.
If `NumStages` is 0, the outputs `out` and `out_valid_next` are directly connected to the inputs `in` and `in_valid_next` without any delay.

The valid-next signals and data path registers are not reset; their initial values are undefined upon power-up.
Each data path register is clock-gated using its corresponding valid-next signal to prevent unnecessary switching activity when the valid-next signal is not asserted.

The `in_valid_next` signal indicates that the input data `in` will be valid on the next clock cycle.
This mechanism allows for timing optimization in scenarios where the data bus is wide and spans a long distance, by separating the timing of the valid signal from the data signal.

== Functional Behavior

* The module delays the input data `in` and its associated valid-next signal `in_valid_next` by `NumStages` clock cycles.
* The valid-next pipeline registers and data path registers are not reset; their initial values are undefined upon power-up.
* For each clock cycle:
  ** The valid-next signal `in_valid_next` is propagated through the pipeline stages.
  ** If `in_valid_next` is asserted (high), indicating that the input data `in` will be valid on the next clock cycle, the data path registers are prepared to capture `in` in the next cycle.
  ** Each data path register is clock-gated using its corresponding valid-next signal to prevent unnecessary toggling when the data is not valid.
  ** The valid-next signal `out_valid_next` at the output reflects the delayed version of `in_valid_next`:
     *** `out_valid_next(t) = in_valid_next(t - NumStages)` for `t â‰¥ NumStages`.
  ** When `out_valid_next` is asserted (high), it indicates that the output data `out` will be valid on the next clock cycle:
     *** `out(t + 1) = in(t + 1 - NumStages)` for the cycles where `out_valid_next(t)` is high.
  ** When `out_valid_next` is deasserted (low), the corresponding data path register is not updated.
  The user should consider the value of `out` to be undefined during these times and must ensure that invalid data is not used.

== Latency and Throughput

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Latency Metric | Cycles | Description

| Latency
| `NumStages`
| The outputs are equal to the inputs after a delay of `NumStages` clock cycles.

| Throughput
| 1
| The module can accept and process a new valid-next input every clock cycle.

| Reset Latency
| `NumStages`
| Since the pipeline registers are not reset, the outputs `out_valid_next` and `out` will remain undefined for `NumStages` cycles after the upstream logic enters reset.

== Timing Diagram

To clarify the timing relationship between `in_valid_next`, `in`, `out_valid_next`, and `out`, consider the following timing diagram for a single-stage delay (`NumStages = 1`):

[cols="1,1,1,1,1",options="header"]

| Cycle (t)
| `in_valid_next`
| `in`
| `out_valid_next`
| `out`

| D0
| 1
|

| 2
| 0
| D1

| 3

Recall:

* `in_valid_next` at time `t` indicates that `in` at time `t+1` will be valid.
* `out_valid_next` at time `t` indicates that `out` at time `t+1` will be valid.
