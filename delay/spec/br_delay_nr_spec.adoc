= Bedrock-RTL Delay Line (No Reset) Specification

== Overview

The `br_delay_nr` module implements a configurable delay line that delays an input signal `in` by a fixed number of clock cycles specified by the `NumStages` parameter. The delayed signal is output on `out`. If `NumStages` is 0, the output `out` is directly connected to the input `in` without any delay. The module supports a parameterizable bit width of the input and output signals through the `BitWidth` parameter. Unlike `br_delay`, this variant does not include a reset signal, and the pipeline registers are not reset.

== Parameters

[cols="1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Scope | Description

| `BitWidth`
| `int`
| module
| Must be at least 1. Specifies the bit width of the input and output signals.

| `NumStages`
| `int`
| module
| Must be at least 0. Specifies the number of pipeline stages (delay cycles).

== Interfaces

[cols="1,1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Interface | Port Direction | Port Type | Port Name | Description

| Clock
| `input`
| `logic`
| `clk`
| Clock signal.

| Data Input
| `input`
| `logic [BitWidth-1:0]`
| `in`
| Input signal to be delayed.

| Data Output
| `output`
| `logic [BitWidth-1:0]`
| `out`
| Delayed output signal.

== Functional Behavior

* The module delays the input `in` by `NumStages` clock cycles.
* The pipeline registers do not have a reset; their initial contents are undefined upon power-up.
* For each clock cycle:
  ** The input `in` is sampled on the rising edge of `clk` and progresses through the pipeline stages.
  ** The output `out` reflects the value of `in` from `NumStages` cycles earlier:
    *** `out(t) = in(t - NumStages)` for `t ≥ NumStages`.
* Before `NumStages` cycles have elapsed since power-up, the output `out` will reflect the initial contents of the uninitialized pipeline registers, which are undefined.

== Latency and Throughput

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Latency Metric | Cycles | Description

| Data Delay
| `NumStages`
| The output `out` reflects the input `in` delayed by `NumStages` clock cycles.

| Throughput
| 1
| The module can accept and process a new input every clock cycle.

| Initialization Latency
| `NumStages`
| Since the pipeline registers are not reset, the output `out` will be undefined for the first `NumStages` cycles after power-up.
