= Bedrock-RTL Delay Line Specification

== Overview

The `br_delay` module implements a configurable delay line that delays an input signal `in` by a fixed number of clock cycles specified by the `NumStages` parameter. The delayed signal is output on `out`. If `NumStages` is 0, the output `out` is directly connected to the input `in` without any delay. The module supports a parameterizable bit width of the input and output signals through the `Width` parameter. All pipeline registers are reset synchronously to 0 upon assertion of the reset signal `rst`.

== Parameters

[cols="1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Parameter | Type | Scope | Description

| `Width`
| `int`
| module
| Must be at least 1. Specifies the bit width of the input and output signals.

| `NumStages`
| `int`
| module
| Must be at least 0. Specifies the number of pipeline stages (delay cycles).

== Interfaces

[cols="1,1,1,1,3"]
|===
| Interface | Port Direction | Port Type | Port Name | Description

| Clock
| `input`
| `logic`
| `clk`
| Clock signal, positive edge-triggered.

| Reset
| `input`
| `logic`
| `rst`
| Synchronous active-high reset signal. Resets all pipeline registers to 0.

| Data Input
| `input`
| `logic [Width-1:0]`
| `in`
| Input signal to be delayed.

| Data Output
| `output`
| `logic [Width-1:0]`
| `out`
| Delayed output signal.
|===

== Functional Behavior

* Upon assertion of the reset signal `rst`, all pipeline registers are reset to 0.
* After reset is deasserted, the module delays the input `in` by `NumStages` clock cycles.
* For each clock cycle after reset deassertion:
  ** If the number of cycles since reset deassertion `t` is less than `NumStages` (`t < NumStages`), the output `out` will be 0.
  ** If `t ≥ NumStages`, then the output `out` will equal the value of `in` from `t - NumStages` cycles earlier:
    *** `out(t) = in(t - NumStages)` for `t ≥ NumStages`.

== Latency and Throughput

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Latency Metric | Cycles | Description

| Data Delay
| `NumStages`
| The output `out` reflects the input `in` delayed by `NumStages` clock cycles.

| Throughput
| 1
| The module can accept and process a new input every clock cycle.

| Reset Latency
| 1
| After asserting `rst`, the pipeline registers are reset to 0 on the next rising edge of `clk`.
