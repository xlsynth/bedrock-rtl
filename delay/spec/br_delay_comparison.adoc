| Reset Includes Datapath
| Data Timing
| Initial Pipeline Values
| Key Use Case

| `br_delay`
| No
| Yes
| Yes
| N/A
| 0
| Use when output values are always treated as valid and must be known 0 when exiting reset.

| `br_delay_nr`
| No
| No (used for assertions only)
| N/A
| N/A
| undefined
| Use when output values are always treated as valid after exiting reset, and reset can be held long enough to flush through any initial value.

| `br_delay_valid`
| `valid`
| Yes
| No
| Same cycle
| valid: 0, data: undefined
| Use when output values are only sometimes valid.

| `br_delay_valid_next`
| `valid-next`
| Yes
| No
| Next cycle
| valid_next: 0, data: undefined
| Use when output values are only sometimes valid, and static timing may be tight (e.g., pipelining a wide bus over a long wire distance).

| `br_delay_valid_next_nr`
| `valid-next`
| No (used for assertions only)
| N/A
| Next cycle
| undefined
| Use when output values are only sometimes valid, static timing may be tight (e.g., pipelining a wide bus over a long wire distance), and reset can be held long enough to flush all the valid bits to 0.
