= Bedrock-RTL Flow Register (Combined Forward & Reverse Variant) Specification

== Overview

A dataflow pipeline register that behaves like a 2-entry FIFO.
It uses the AMBA-inspired ready-valid handshake protocol for synchronizing pipeline stages and stalling when encountering backpressure hazards.
The data progress from one stage to another when both the corresponding ready signal and valid signal are both 1 on the same cycle.
Otherwise, the stage is stalled.
Data ordering is strictly preserved by the design.

NOTE: This variant of the flow register flops all output signals.
It comes the cost of roughly 2X the flop count and area compared with the forward-only and reverse-only variants.

== Assumptions

The following assumptions are constraints on the input stimulus to the design.

* Width integration check: Width parameter must be set to at least 1.
* Push-side backpressure check: If `push_valid` is 1 and `push_ready` is 0, then on the following cycle `push_valid` must still be 1 and `push_data` must not have changed.
* `push_data` known check: If `push_valid` is 1, `push_data` should not be unknown (X).
* `pop_ready` eventual validity check: If `pop_valid` is 1, `pop_ready` must eventually be 1.

== Timing, Latency, and Throughput

All outputs are driven directly by registers.

[cols="1,1,3"]
|===
| Latency Metric | Cycles | Description

| Cut-through
| 1
| Minimum delay from `push_valid` to `pop_valid`

| Backpressure
| 1
| Minimum delay from `pop_ready` to `push_ready`
|===

This module can sustain a peak throughput of one transaction per cycle on both the push and pop interfaces.
